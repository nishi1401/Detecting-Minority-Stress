3,"This year I moved in with 3 other guys, in an off-campus house, at college. We go to a school that is in a rural area, and tend to get isolated with each other, unless we make an effort to get out of that group. I haven't been dating because I've been focusing on school, and have been masturbating to meet my sexual needs. One of my roommates is gay, and he has openly come onto me, and my other two roommates have come onto me (especially during the winter when we were stuck together) and I started to for the first time consider romance with a man. I find my roommates unattractive, even repulsive because of their hygiene and personal confidence, but I too have had low self esteem because of the lack of romantic validation. I feel like I'm being forced into a romance with men, and I don't know how to handle it. What would you do? Can anyone relate?",0

14,"Heya /lgbt/,



I read a lot and work in a bookstore. I always try to research and collect titles by queer people or about queer culture, and decided to only read books of this ilk during 2016. I wanted to share what I've read so far, and would greatly appreciate your suggestions or titles you've read this year too. :)



[Gay Berlin by Robert Beachy](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20890457-gay-berlin)



Really engrossing history, sociology and culture study. Traces prominent figured like Magnus Hirschfeld, founder of the Scientific Humanitarian Committee. Traces the history of a diverse queer scene from the 1800's to 1933. Loved this book and recommend to people all the time!



[Our Young Man by Edmund White](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663628-our-young-man?from_search=true)

I got this as an Advanced Reading Copy. I've had Edmund White on my radar for a while and enjoyed this one too. The plot isn't super original but it has great character portrayals and reminded me a bit of Irvine Welsh, who I adore.



[Speak My Language by Torsten Højer](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27834064-speak-my-language-and-other-stories?ac=1&amp;from_search=true)



An anthology of gay fiction. Pretty straightforward premise that doesn't prepare you for the breadth of genres and themes explored within. There's a fantastic sci-fi love story, a fair share of seedy hookup stories and gay tragedy, Patrick White nailing a whole British family vibe, a story featuring a seraphim that made me weep at the end like a baby. It covers the globe from Russia to Australia, Britain to Sri Lanka. There were only one or two stories I didn't find fantastic.



I got to meet Patrick White in store and tell him how great his story Brown Manilla was (I hadn't finished it at that point, thank god he didn't ask me how I felt about it!)



[A Boy's Own Story by Edmund White](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1025100.A_Boy_s_Own_Story?ac=1&amp;from_search=true)



I'll fess up: I haven't finished this one. The writing is vivid and feels honest, but I didn't get into it as much as Our Own Boy. I hope to finish this one before the year is up, as I have a collection of works by him to read too.



[Champagne Supernovas by Maureen Callahan](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18144103-champagne-supernovas?ac=1&amp;from_search=true)



Terrible title, but a fairly good little fashion biography about Marc Jacobs, Alexander McQueen and Kate Moss. 2/3 ain't bad. I just finished it yesterday and while it didn't stand up to things like Gods and Kings by Thomas, it was a easy read to pass the time.



So that's it so far! For books to come, I also attempted to read [a Basquiat bio](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/118572.Basquiat), [Giovanni's Room](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38462.Giovanni_s_Room?ac=1&amp;from_search=true) and a couple others to no avail. I'd love to hear any suggestions you might have about good reads in this ""genre"". :)",0
15,I'm 13 and I've never been very open with my sexuality. Idk if this is the correct type of post for this sub Reddit and if it isn't feel free to delete this but... IM GAY,0
16,"Hello, my name is Joe. I am a 24 year old gay man, working as a healthcare assistant in the NHS, and I have just started a petition to lift the ban on gay and bisexual men from donating blood whilst sexually active in the UK.



As you are probably aware, men who have sex with men are banned from donating blood whilst sexually active, and even individuals in STD free monogamous relationships are banned from donating.



This is unnecessary, as all samples are rigorously tested for infection, and this ban can only increase the stigma around homosexual life.



Please help me to lift this ban by signing the petition, and sharing it with others via email, facebook, and any other means possible.



I will be reaching out to as many LGBT groups and societies as possible, but any help will be greatly appreciated.



Please find the link to the petition below,

Thankyou for your time.

17,"I am meeting with a doctor for a hormone readiness assessment next week and I’m not sure what they are expecting. I looked online and found that one of the criteria was ‘persistent, well-documented gender dysphoria.’



I’m hoping someone who’s been through this can help me understand what they’re looking for. What do they mean by ‘well-documented’? Should I have been keeping a diary of every time I’ve felt garbo from dysphoria??",0
18,"Ok, first of all, I have really bad anxiety and tend to focus on my personal worst case scenarios and I have questioned my sexuality many times before, for no good reason.

All of a sudden, I started worrying I might be asexual. I only have two good reasons for this: I don't really fantasize a lot, and when I see a guy I think is really hot i never think ""wow I want to have sex with him"", like apparently ""normal"" people do. I don't imagine him naked, I sometimes feel like ""ok I want to touch his body and make out with him passionately""

I've only had a below the belt sexual experience with my boyfriend and I need to be very emotionally comfortable with the person before I'm ok with them touching and seeing me naked, is that normal? Therefore, I don't imagine having sex with guys or them touching below the belt if I find them attractive because I'm uncomfortable with it if I'm not very close to them

Is this a ridiculous thing to worry about? I definitely enjoy sex a lot (I know some asexuals do), but I don't often crave it. I have a lot of anxiety problems and stress from school, could that be it?

In the beginning stages of my relationship with my ex boyfriend, I was super into everything sexual. I would do everything possible in order to get a room alone with him so we could explore each other's bodies. I'm more worried because I enjoyed what he was doing to me more than I enjoyed what I was doing to him.

I wouldn't want to have a relationship without sex, but when I'm busy and distracted I can go months without thinking about it, and I don't desire anything more than making out and touching with strangers. I have more of a responsive desire which I read was common with women- is that true? I won't be in the mood for sex at all but if my boyfriend starts touching me or kissing me I'll get really frisky and want it.

All in all- does my lack of concrete sexual fantasies/not imagining guys I'm attracted to touching me genitally/having sex with me (just making out) unless I'm comfortable mean I'm asexual? By what I've said would I be considered asexual?

Like I said, I have personally enjoyed sex in the past. It wasn't so much about his body visually as I enjoyed him touching and exploring me and the intimacy I felt with sexual experiences.

Thank you so much.",0
19,We have to stick together no matter what ends up happening. We have to help the people struggling with fear and sadness. Let's try to clear our minds of politics. But most important: ***WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP!***,0
20,"The thought of ending our relationship has been on my mind a lot lately, and I want the thoughts to be gone. 

We have been together for 10 months now and everything has been up and down(just like any other relationship). As time passes, there are small things about him that are starting to annoy me, and I don't know how to go about handling them. To begin, when we argue, the blame usually(always) gets thrown on me... Even when it's not even my fault! Of course, I TRY and do my best to understand both sides of our fights and arguments. If I'm not completely at fault, I still try to figure out what I can do to avoid such instances from happening in the future and how I can make things better for the both of us. If he's wrong, he will NOT admit it! Even if it's obvious that he did wrong, my partner will completely ignore his faults and throw the blame on me and what I did wrong to lead up to the current situation. 

Here's an example: The other day he was grabbing his meal for work out of the refrigerator, but notices there was a tupperware of food sitting outside on the counter. He automatically assumes it was me who moved the tupperware from the fridge and proceeds to go into an argument about the situation. Mind you, there are two other young individuals whom live in his home as well( bf's nephew who is 20 &amp; bf's daughter who is 10). I argue back and tell him, that I didn't go in the refrigerator yet and to ask his nephew if he did it... My boyfriend ignored me. I told him not to assume that I did something when it wasn't even me who had done it to begin with. He still ignored me and changed the subject. I called him out for doing that. 

He can't accept being wrong sometimes and its very annoying. It's the same thing when it comes to his daughter as well... He tries to push her on me sometimes(responsibilities), and tries to make me responsible for her. She's only 10 and she lives with him part-time(3 days), and stays with her mom for most of the week. 

I understand that his daughter comes before I do. I completely get that. I just don't feel that the responsibility of a child needs to be rolled over to me. I've babysat, I've taken/picked her up from school, I've picked her up from her grandparents, etc. I've done a lot for this young girl and I feel like I have the responsibility of a parent, which I do not want. It's even gotten to the point where my boyfriend won't even ask me sometimes to help out; he will just assume. Example: ""Brittany's mom is going out of town for a few days, you'll need to babysit for me while I'm at work."" I don't think that's right, but if I say something or don't feel it's right, I get ignored and he gets upset with me for small periods of time. He'll even bring up how i'll do favors for my friends, but not for him(which is wrong). 

It's just little things such as these two instances that make me want to end it all, but we do have good memories, good times, and good things that we both do and enjoy together. But seriously, am I over thinking this situation or is my gut telling me the right thing? Please help. 



TLDR: I've been having thoughts of breaking up with my boyfriend for a few weeks now, but I don't know if its really the right thing to do. He can't accept being wrong when we have arguments/always blames me, and he pushes the responsibility of his 10 Y/O daughter on me sometimes without asking, and it's becoming annoying. ",0

23,"Hi, everyone. Straight to my story, I am currently a closet bi in college. I act straight and most people I know think I'm straight. Me and this guy met through the fraternity. The first moment I saw him, I already fell for him, like I don't even know his name. Me and Blue (let's call him Blue) have been really close friends for over a year now. During this time, I always have a crush on him, like the more I know him, the more I love him. He kinda give me mixed signals, too, like I don't know if he's flirting or not. Whenever I got drunk, he just let me to stay over his place. One time, I got really drunk, he literally hugged me and held my hands and carried me to his place. Recently, he just broke up with his girlfriend, who he still has a lot of feelings for. He sometimes just randomly texted me Hi and asked how am I. One time, while we were talking about women, he just randomly said ""I would date you Red"", which I thought he was joking and I switched subjects. He texted me ""I love you"" randomly before and followed with messages with heart emojis. That night we had a really deep conversation, but the moment I mentioned I was seeing someone, and was deeply in love with someone (who is him), I felt like his mood changed and like ""Ok bro"" and followed up with awkward silence. I know, I know when you love someone so much, your brain kinda makes things up, but I feel like this guy really looks out for me, I dont know if it is as friend or more. Everytime we talked, I felt like there was something held back between us. He never talked about women in front of me, unless I asked. But when we all hang out with our friends, he talks about it. Like you definitely know there's something there. What do you guys think I should do? And we definitely will see each other a lot next semester and go on, since we are in the same frat. So yeah ... THank you for reading tl;dr:  I am a closet bi and deeply in love with a guy. What should I do?",0
24,"Hello everyone of LGBT Subreddit!



I have been kind of having a crisis here lately over recent events.  Before any of that, I must explain that I have been in a clinical depression for about 11 years now.  Recently, just before my Junior year in college ends, I've been hit with a bout of happiness and clarity and I think my depression might finally be lifting.  The thing I'm having a problem with is how to go about reinventing my entire self.  With my depression for so long, somewhere along the line I forgot who I was or what I was even like before depression, and even then I was a kid.  



As an LGBT student about to hit their Senior year of Undergrad, I have no idea what to do.  I already told myself to dedicate myself to  losing weight over the summer (yeah, being fat and gay fucking sucks). I've been socially isolated for so long and I have made 0 friends at college and I feel like I have wasted my entire college experience because my depression got in the way of enjoying anything my college offered besides constant papers. How does one go about making friends? How do I form lasting friendships over a ""I say hi to you and lightly chat before and after class""?  I don't even know really how to approach people or talk to them without messing everything up. 



I've been thinking of joining my colleges GSA, HEROES, next year to at least say I joined 1 club at college. I have known about the club since Freshman year but I have always been to scared to go.  I've gotten the pleasure of having the clubs President in one of my classes this semester, and have had a few conversations with him.  Though, learning about the club through him has also made me kind of scared as well as it showed me that the club is a very extrovertedly geared, political rally poster carrying type of people from what I've seen so far.  I don't think I'd fit in there and it makes me really nervous because if I don't fit in with other LGBT members, where do I belong? I don't know, being social is a very new thing to me thanks to being an Internet Hermit with depression, but I think I'm going to really try to change myself regardless.",0

28,"I have been dating the same guy for 3.5 years. When we first met, I was married to a woman. I was an addict, closeted, depressed, and miserable. He was 'the other man' with whom I was cheating on my wife. He was and remains discreet, independent, and semi-closeted. In the past two years, I have: come out to my wife; my three kids; my family; and my co-workers. I'm now 1.5 years sober and getting my life back on track. But as I've evolved, he's still semi-closeted and it's starting to cause friction. We're the same age (44) and while you can pretend 'no one knows' when you're in your 20s, EVERYONE in his family knows he's gay when he hasn't brought a girlfriend home in 20+ years. I've met most of his family as a 'friend' and the knowing stares confirmed it. So in a strange twist, I'm with a man who is closeted with himself and despite all evidence that his whole family knows (most recently a Facebook message from his sister-in-law stating unequivocally ""We all know he's gay, have heard all about you, and are happy he's with you!""). I immediately sent him the message as I have a no more secrets policy. He's now retreated to the fall-back position of saying, ""Well there is no way my parents know."" I've taken the rather bold step of inviting his brother and sister-in-law over for dinner next week. I'm hoping this will change the course of our relationship. My questions are: 1. Am I 'outing' someone when his family already knew? 2. Truly this is a case when my boyfriend can't accept his own homosexuality as his family so clearly knows. If true, how can I help him? ",0

If you are up to date on modern science and polotics you'll know that there's this new version of this thing called CRISPR that allow scientists to easily edit DNA and RNA. 



Also other studies have been going on in the last few years showing results that there could in fact be a Lesbian and Gay gene. 

(Basically there are two version. One that makes people more attracted to women and one more attracted to men. In men one will make them have more children the other will make them gay)



Also, the UK has recently allowed the use of CRISPR to remove genetic related diseases. This will likely lead the way for more legal DNA editing in the future not only in the UK but in other countries.



Now here's the question. Would you remove or not remove the Lesbian/Gay genes? If so why? If not why?

53,"Ok, first of all, I have really bad anxiety and tend to focus on my personal worst case scenarios and I have questioned my sexuality many times before, for no good reason.

All of a sudden, I started worrying I might be asexual. I only have two good reasons for this: I don't really fantasize a lot, and when I see a guy I think is really hot i never think ""wow I want to have sex with him"", like apparently ""normal"" people do. I don't imagine him naked, I sometimes feel like ""ok I want to touch his body and make out with him passionately""

I've only had a below the belt sexual experience with my boyfriend and I need to be very emotionally comfortable with the person before I'm ok with them touching and seeing me naked, is that normal? Therefore, I don't imagine having sex with guys or them touching below the belt if I find them attractive because I'm uncomfortable with it if I'm not very close to them

Is this a ridiculous thing to worry about? I definitely enjoy sex a lot (I know some asexuals do), but I don't often crave it. I have a lot of anxiety problems and stress from school, could that be it?

In the beginning stages of my relationship with my ex boyfriend, I was super into everything sexual. I would do everything possible in order to get a room alone with him so we could explore each other's bodies. I'm more worried because I enjoyed what he was doing to me more than I enjoyed what I was doing to him.

I wouldn't want to have a relationship without sex, but when I'm busy and distracted I can go months without thinking about it, and I don't desire anything more than making out and touching with strangers. I have more of a responsive desire which I read was common with women- is that true? I won't be in the mood for sex at all but if my boyfriend starts touching me or kissing me I'll get really frisky and want it.

All in all- does my lack of concrete sexual fantasies/not imagining guys I'm attracted to touching me genitally/having sex with me (just making out) unless I'm comfortable mean I'm asexual? By what I've said would I be considered asexual?

Like I said, I have personally enjoyed sex in the past. It wasn't so much about his body visually as I enjoyed him touching and exploring me and the intimacy I felt with sexual experiences.

On the other, I want to tell him that I learned by accident, and that I'm there for him if he ever needs to talk. I'm honestly just so lost and would like any advice.

But suddenly, I don't know what came over me, but I had to tell him, ""This doesn't feel right."" He was right in the middle of kissing my chest when he looked blankly at me. ""I don't think I want to do this,"" I said, and literally got off the bed. He understood but seemed a little taken aback and dare I say, hurt. I made sure to tell him that it wasn't him, just that I wasn't feeling it that day. He understood (thankfully, at least he seemed to), and left after a few awkward glances.

I’m Dominican and Peruvian (I’m also white passing), but I had the privilege of being raised in a relatively accepting household, where my parents (my dad especially) wanted me to be whoever I wanted to be and no one else. With that said, they let me wear whatever I wanted and play with whatever and with whomever I wanted to. Since I was maybe 6 or 7 I dressed in boy clothes and every time I would go shopping I would go straight to the boys section. I loved the clothes and the style and I was most comfortable with that form of dressing. This ended when I finished my 1st year of middle school, I stopped being a “tomboy” because I had a new group of friends. All of my life my best friends had been boys (even in that first year of middle school), but then I became best friends with two girls and their group of friends. They were girly girls, they did their make up, talked about boys, wore clothes from the girls section at hollister and it’s sister stores; basically they were my opposite. I quickly adopted a level of their style and mindset, basically changing myself entirely. I was a little uncomfortable at first but the change was refreshing and didn’t feel off, I was exploring something new and that was okay for me. This really feminine version of me went on until my sophomore year of high school, then I started mixing up my style to be a wee bit more masculine (I began a relationship with my first serious girlfriend and had come out to my school as being pan), it felt right and I was happy with the way I was presenting myself. Claiming my sexual identity was revolutionary and evolved everything about me, including how I presented myself. Now, up until a year or two ago I didn’t question that I was a girl inside. For me, being a girl and going by she/her just meant I had a female anatomy but I could do whatever and be whoever with that. I didn’t consciously or deliberately tie any social implications to the terms. Of course I still had ideas of what it meant to be a girl and what it meant to be a boy, everyone goes through conditioning, but I just viewed myself as me. I still do. 



I know that a lot of this has to do with gender expression, I’ve always felt I could pass as a boy or a girl depending on how I dressed and I like it like that. My confusion is that some days I feel more masculine and other times I don’t, so much so that if I don’t wear clothes that align perfectly with how I’m feeling that day, I’m most likely going to feel anxious, depressed, and generally off-put. I do suffer from depression and anxiety in general but it’s exacerbated those days. I don’t feel like I have to change my body because I have the privilege of having a body that does a pretty good job of appearing however I want it to appear. I think I’m genderfluid, or really just genderqueer to be more broad, but I can’t put my finger on whether that’s a valid assessment. I know everyone has their own definition of what it means to be those things but as a feminist who believes in the ability of people being able to dress/act however they want to and still be cisgendered, how do I know if I am genderqueer? If you are able to remove the social implications of what it means to be a girl and a boy (putting aside the patriarchy and sex-based oppression), does it make a difference if you identify as genderqueer or non-conforming? If yes, what is it exactly that might make us feel that we identify more as a man or a woman (or neither/both) if not the way we are treated by society? 



I really hope this made sense, I know it’s long and my grammar/punctuation isn’t great, and there’s a lot of parentheses but please help! I have sooo many questions and it’s stressing me the fuck out. I feel like I don’t know who I am. I’m okay with not labeling myself because I never really have, but I want to understand as much as possibly because I feel that’s just one more way to be a better human and help others who might be going through a similar circumstance. 



Also please correct me if I’m not using proper terminology or I’m not saying something quite right. ",0
67,"Tonight, I finally admitted to myself what I really am. I had never felt wrong in the labels I chose people I was, but they never truly fit who I felt I was. Not ten minutes ago in the shower, I said; ""I'm not female, and not heterosexual, nor heteromantic. I guess I'm aromantic.. greysexual... and a demigirl""

I've known for a while I was aromantic, and I've never identified as a true female, but been comfortable wth she/her pronouns. But my mind kicked me, and said ""Just accept it, your different.""

Having grown up, and still living in, a Mormon community, I've never felt comfortable with accepting my true self. But I guess I just couldn't do anymore; it just snapped, and now I admit to myself that I am not a perfect little heterosexual Mormon girl (of course being atheist for a while certainly changes that), but instead lgbt. 

For a short time, I thought I was a panromantic asexual- barring the fact I've never felt any significant level of romantic attraction, that is. And I'm not quite asexual, that I can also say.

I guess I just want to say, that I feel very comfortable with myself, finally; after so long as not accepting my true self, it just clicked, and I admit who I really am. I also want to say that people shouldn't hide who they are; I was uncomfortable for a time, saying that I was something i am not, and you should never lie to yourself. That's all I have to say. Thanks :)



tldr; i realized that I'm an lgbtq girl at heart, in a short epiphany in the shower.",0
68,"The thought of ending our relationship has been on my mind a lot lately, and I want the thoughts to be gone. 

We have been together for 10 months now and everything has been up and down(just like any other relationship). As time passes, there are small things about him that are starting to annoy me, and I don't know how to go about handling them. To begin, when we argue, the blame usually(always) gets thrown on me... Even when it's not even my fault! Of course, I TRY and do my best to understand both sides of our fights and arguments. If I'm not completely at fault, I still try to figure out what I can do to avoid such instances from happening in the future and how I can make things better for the both of us. If he's wrong, he will NOT admit it! Even if it's obvious that he did wrong, my partner will completely ignore his faults and throw the blame on me and what I did wrong to lead up to the current situation. 

Here's an example: The other day he was grabbing his meal for work out of the refrigerator, but notices there was a tupperware of food sitting outside on the counter. He automatically assumes it was me who moved the tupperware from the fridge and proceeds to go into an argument about the situation. Mind you, there are two other young individuals whom live in his home as well( bf's nephew who is 20 &amp; bf's daughter who is 10). I argue back and tell him, that I didn't go in the refrigerator yet and to ask his nephew if he did it... My boyfriend ignored me. I told him not to assume that I did something when it wasn't even me who had done it to begin with. He still ignored me and changed the subject. I called him out for doing that. 

He can't accept being wrong sometimes and its very annoying. It's the same thing when it comes to his daughter as well... He tries to push her on me sometimes(responsibilities), and tries to make me responsible for her. She's only 10 and she lives with him part-time(3 days), and stays with her mom for most of the week. 

I understand that his daughter comes before I do. I completely get that. I just don't feel that the responsibility of a child needs to be rolled over to me. I've babysat, I've taken/picked her up from school, I've picked her up from her grandparents, etc. I've done a lot for this young girl and I feel like I have the responsibility of a parent, which I do not want. It's even gotten to the point where my boyfriend won't even ask me sometimes to help out; he will just assume. Example: ""Brittany's mom is going out of town for a few days, you'll need to babysit for me while I'm at work."" I don't think that's right, but if I say something or don't feel it's right, I get ignored and he gets upset with me for small periods of time. He'll even bring up how i'll do favors for my friends, but not for him(which is wrong). 

It's just little things such as these two instances that make me want to end it all, but we do have good memories, good times, and good things that we both do and enjoy together. But seriously, am I over thinking this situation or is my gut telling me the right thing? Please help. 



TLDR: I've been having thoughts of breaking up with my boyfriend for a few weeks now, but I don't know if its really the right thing to do. He can't accept being wrong when we have arguments/always blames me, and he pushes the responsibility of his 10 Y/O daughter on me sometimes without asking, and it's becoming annoying. ",0

70,"How do you know if you're straight or L/G/B? I'm female, and I've always thought that I was straight. Have never really thought any other way, just assumed that was the way it is, growing up in a conservative Asian family. However, recently I had a heart-to-heart chat with my L friend who shared with me her experience and enlightened me that I might be higher on the Kinsey Scale than I'd thought. 



I've never been in a relationship, and am still a virgin. I fell in love with a guy once, but that was sadly an unrequited thing. While my friends go on about hot guy celebrities that I agree with, I also secretly harbor numerous girl celebrity crushes. I enjoy lesbian porn more than any other kind. I have always wanted to live together with a female, like in a married sense but I didn't really think about the sex part because I was brought up in a culture that rejects sexual relations between two people of the same biological sex. All that said, I've never felt any kind of sexual desire for my girl friends, though I've had thoughts of wanting to live with them and having a happy life together. I think that's because I enjoyed their company, but I don't know if it was, in fact, more than that. 



I am just so confused, having never had real experience in relationships and all that to define my preferences. Guess I just had to get this out - it's been weighing on my mind for weeks - and hope for some advice or stories about how you discovered yourself! Thank you, awesome people, for reading :)

If you're looking for stories involving queer people of all genders and orientations, Lovecraftian monsters, a little bit of blood and guts, and a whole lot of weird and gross shit, I think I might be right up your alley ;)



Here's the snarky little synopsis from my webpage: 

*""It’s about a bisexual college freshman named Ruthie who makes a bunch of bad decisions while trying to find her missing sister and ends up running into a host of terrifying monsters, not to mention a mysterious woman with a shotgun and a gas mask who knows a little more about all this than she should. And, as most things do, it all goes to shit from there.""*



Right now, Episode 1, NGLUI.1., can be read for free at [Smashwords](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/695972) and [iBooks](https://itun.es/us/Bb0lhb.l) and for $0.99 at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N6Q0S2T/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484176824&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=K.M.+White+the+secret+of+mount+haile) even though I price-matched it to iBooks and it'll hopefully be free super soon. Not going to lie, the other episodes are going to be a consistent $0.99, but they'll probably be longer and really get into the meat of the series--not to mention that I plan to do a host of discounts further along.

73,"I have been dating the same guy for 3.5 years. When we first met, I was married to a woman. I was an addict, closeted, depressed, and miserable. He was 'the other man' with whom I was cheating on my wife. He was and remains discreet, independent, and semi-closeted. In the past two years, I have: come out to my wife; my three kids; my family; and my co-workers. I'm now 1.5 years sober and getting my life back on track. But as I've evolved, he's still semi-closeted and it's starting to cause friction. We're the same age (44) and while you can pretend 'no one knows' when you're in your 20s, EVERYONE in his family knows he's gay when he hasn't brought a girlfriend home in 20+ years. I've met most of his family as a 'friend' and the knowing stares confirmed it. So in a strange twist, I'm with a man who is closeted with himself and despite all evidence that his whole family knows (most recently a Facebook message from his sister-in-law stating unequivocally ""We all know he's gay, have heard all about you, and are happy he's with you!""). I immediately sent him the message as I have a no more secrets policy. He's now retreated to the fall-back position of saying, ""Well there is no way my parents know."" I've taken the rather bold step of inviting his brother and sister-in-law over for dinner next week. I'm hoping this will change the course of our relationship. My questions are: 1. Am I 'outing' someone when his family already knew? 2. Truly this is a case when my boyfriend can't accept his own homosexuality as his family so clearly knows. If true, how can I help him? ",0
74,"So Im a guy, but I always keep imagining myself as a girl and sort of wanting to be a girl, thinking of a girl name for me, etc. But at the same time, I still want to keep my penis and legally still be male. Is there a specific term for this?

I just moved to a new town and know ZERO people within a 100km radius.

I finally made a new friend,  who seemed awesome! 



Today, mid conversation while lamenting about how we only ever get to wear t shirts and jeans in the wood shop (we're in school for carpentry), she turns to me and says 



""At least I don't look like a d*ke though I guess! Haha! :)"" 



I am done. Giving up. I'll never find my people.



Sorry I just really needed somewhere to vent. ",1
80,"First off, a disclaimer.

I'm not 100% familiar with all the genders and sexualities. The genders I am familiar with are male, female and agender. And the only sexualities I know are homosexuality, bisexuality, pansexuality, and asexuality.





So I am a male, in my teens and bisexual. The things i usually do are, well, usual. Except for the occasional recreational drug use.



Here's where the story begins:

A couple of weeks ago I was on vacation with two male friends of mine, and we planned to try out MDMA for our first times. Now me and one of them being informed guys, we researched a lot and made sure almost nothing that you'd expect with the substance could go wrong. We had a fair expectation of the experience, so we set on our yourney.



Forward to the next morning, all in all it went great. But all day I had a strange feeling. at the end of the day during my shower I realised I felt more feminine for whatever reason. I brushed it off as the comedown impacting me and went on. the rest of the vacation this feeling continued, but i told myself: If I still have this feeling in 2 weeks, I'll properly think this out.



Forward to after the vacation, and you guessed it, the feeling is still there. So i started considering the fact I may feel more like a girl than a boy. I didn't like the idea at first and I'm currently still not 100% with it. but far enough to consider it. First thing i did was think: ""Have i ever felt like a girl/wanted to be a girl before?"" I remembered when i was about 5 years old, I preferred playing with the girl. But i never could, and had to play with the boys. At that moment I vaguely remember myself think, i wish was a girl. And all my life I've thought that penises were disgusting. Especially my own. Although i am attracted to men, I would never see myself in a sexual relationship with one.



So i went on and researched how far science has gone in ""turning me into a proper woman"" and I was amazed! The only additional surgery I had to undergo part from bottom surgery, was an optional surgery so I don't sound like a man anymore. And seeing i have a fairly deep voice, that could become a necessity for me.



So that brings me here, now. I still haven't decided. Neither have i told anyone, although I am bringing it up next time I see my best (female) friend. but I worry about being looked down upon by certain friends, and especially family. And it does not help that even I myself are not sure it's even true, or that it's just a symptom of some bigger affliction.

81,"So my mom recently found a purse with Audrey Hepburn on it for really cheap and she got it for me because she knows I like her. I know she meant it as a collectible but part of me wants to actually use it. I hate carrying my things in my pockets (3DS, keys, wallet, etc) so I've been considering using a tote or bag or purse to carry my things around but I'm really nervous and scared. Does anyone have any experience dealing with this or using purses as a male? Is it awkward? Do people give you dirty looks? ",1
82,"Whenever I enter into an LGBT space I can assume with reasonable certainty that there will be those white racist gays that will outright spit in your face in what is supposed to be a safe space from discrimination. 



On Grindr and other dating situations it will be those ""no blacks, no fems, no fats"" racists who then don't even have the guts to admit their racism and will babble some nonsense about how it's their preference. Uhm..how do you think you got this preference? This conviction that blacks are inherently undesirable didn't fall from the sky, duh! Our white supremacist society favors the Eurocentric ideal of beauty and the white-centric media shoves it into our faces 24/7!



All of this has led me to feel uncomfortable and unwelcome whenever I enter predominantly white LGBT spaces. Even within the minority we're treated like the bottom of the barrel. I'm just so tired of it.",1
83,Soooo recently i came out as gay and for the most part my friends have been supportive of me. The one problem I ran into was everyone told me I dont seem gay at all. Like not even one bit. They say I’m not flamboyant enough and my “voice isn’t gay”. Someone even went as far to tell me that I’m NOT gay. How do I handle this?,1
84,"Hey, I'm obviously bisexual from the title. Lol. But unfortunately I feel like I'm shamed in every type of group of people for being sexually and romantically interested in both men and women. I feel like people from the lgbt community are just as judgy toward me for being this way, and it really sucks to not fully feel like I'm accepted anywhere except by other bi people. What I'm really looking for and am curious about with this post is, are we really accepted in the lgbt community?",1
85,"So recently I started work at my first job in a field related to my degree (woo!) and generally things have been awesome so far. It took a lot of effort to get here, and it's nice to feel like I'm progressing in life.  

But today, I overheard stuff that's making me think twice. I don't even know his name, but I know he's more senior than me and I think he's a team leader for one of the projects but I haven't really had a direct interaction with him other than when he stole my seat from my desk, but I didn't realise that since he wasn't in it when I noticed it had been moved. He yelled at me for taking it back, and that was that.  

But today I heard him make comments which I didn't really like, starting off a Skype call with someone asking if the other person if they were ""Being queer and kissing a lot of men"". Fine, I don't know the context such as if the person on the other end was gay and it was just playful conversation between friends, but even so idk if it's really work appropriate.  

In addition to not knowing the context for sure, he's obviously someone more senior than me, I started at work literally a week ago and I really need this job. I'm scared if I make a comment to HR like I feel I should, I'll get seen as a troublemaker and would paint a target on my back, not just because I'm speaking out but because I'm also pretty much screaming ""Yes, the reason I object to those comments is because I like men and took it a teeny bit personally"". And if he is openly homophobic, what if it's because it's seen as OK here, and outing myself will make a bunch of other people get hostile?  

I don't really know if there's a point to this because I feel like I'm genuinely stuck and need to bite my tongue, but yeah. What should I do?



Edit - Thank you everyone for all the advice and support :)",1
86,"Just 3 days ago I've come to accept I'm not straight and it's the most shocked feel of realisation I've ever felt in my entire life. I don't know what I am but I've felt depressed about it ever since. I've always seen myself with the opposite gender and being part of a traditional family. 

I'd put all my effort and all my energy to be straight. This just doesn't seem right for me; this isn't what I wanted. I just have a deep desire to just be straight... to just be like every other guy. Is it too much to ask?



I really don't like change. If something changes the way I don't want it to, I get anxiety and depression. I know of a bisexual and she accepted her sexuality within 2 days. I wish I could be like that.



If I was straight:

I wouldn't have to spend all my time at night searching on Google if I can change my sexuality and how I can do so.

I wouldn't have to feel empty and depressed all the time.

I wouldn't have to distract myself with social media just to keep my mind off of it just so I might bear to live another day.



Every day is just full of suffering for me, I can't keep my mind off of it unless I'm doing something super engaging. I think I'd be better off dead instead of living a life I don't want, with a ridiciously sensitive mind that can't accept the smallest changes.



Is there a way for me to change my sexuality?

 Can I  rewire my brain by doing certain activites?

There has to be something out there, there are many people like me suffering. The world can't just leave us to die.



Edit: Woah 1.1k views! Just seeing that much people care to see what I have to say is amazing. It'll take me a very long time to accept who I am though...



Edit: Maybe I should leave this for future me to solve. Doesn't matter what my sexuality is right now, because honestly I'm not that interested in finding a partner yet. I'm still in highschool, I'm 14.",1
87,"It just happened yesterday. Chinese government is removing violent and sexual content on internet now, including content that influence people’s sexual orientation. In fact, starting two month ago, Chinese government starts to hardcore censure liberal ideas online such as LGBT right or feminism.



Yesterday I asked my mom what she thought on LGBT, I roughly wrote it down. 



My mom said homosexuality or LGBT is not a choice, but an innate characteristic people are born with. This is inevitable. (Being gay is inevitable). She said people shouldn’t discriminate LGBT people because LGBT people has no other choice but abnormal sexual orientation. She also said, however, that there exists a lot of LGBT people who is not born with their LGBT characteristics. The fact they identify themselves as LGBT is the result of misleading social influence. A lot of people think the idea of LGBT is cool and liberal, so that they wanna be part of it. She think such social influence or social guidance is wrong and should be corrected.



Majority of Chinese people are learnt not to discriminate LGBT group. But the reason behind it is totally warped and misleading. They think LGBT people are pitiful like disable people who need cares in this society. They think they are “saint” towards LGBT people because they hold sympathy towards them. But this whole idea is fucking bullshit because people are equal from the first place and LGBT people are exactly the same. Now, Chinese government is censuring  



I don’t really know or wanna talk about the political action behind this. What I want to talk about is how the mainstream thought on LGBT



I post it here not because my mom is specially conservative or anything, but her thought reflected most of Chinese people’s value. She received high education and support me to study abroad.

88,"I recently got a new job at a school. I handle resources, working with and in the library and other resource-related areas. I'm the youngest at my new workplace, so I felt like a fish out of water. That, combined with social anxiety issues, meant I didn't feel very comfortable around my coworkers despite their friendliness. At my old workplace, the others were homophobic because they were religious, so I didn't dare talk about LGBT issues. Coming out would've ruined their opinion of me. I figured it'd be the same here.



We were getting some new library books ready today. I asked one of my coworkers (who is practically my supervisor) about complaints the library has received from parents, and she told a few stories. Some of the complaints they'd gotten were understandable and resulted in the book being withdrawn, some were ridiculous and over-dramatic. Then, she picked up one of the new books in her covering pile and said she was worried we would get complaints about it. It was Heather Has Two Mommies. She went on a short rant about how kids shouldn't be taught to hate, and that she can't stand seeing little kids saying homophobic things. She said the school plans to stand its ground and refuse to remove the book if we ever do get complaints about it.



Let me emphasise this. They got a book they *knew* they would get complaints about, and plan to defend that choice if criticised. All in the name of protecting and spreading awareness of LGBT people.



I don't come out to people unless I feel they ought to know, so my boss and coworkers will probably never find out unless they start asking about my SO. But her rant made me feel so accepted. Unlike my old workplace, where LGBT topics were taboo, my coworkers here want to see a world where we're treated no differently from everyone else and parents don't raise their kids to be homophobic. The age gap still makes me feel a little odd, but I feel more like I belong now. Shortly after, she went to answer a front desk phone call. When she was out of the room, I smiled so much my cheeks hurt and I came close to crying.

Today my sis was laughing at the ""First black president"" Clinton joke, my dad said that was disgusting and nasty. And that Americans have their culture and black people have theirs(Africans to be specific). He also said that's how here in America they let two men sleep and in Europe they have gay male hotels or something like that. My sister was like ""Ew disgusting""! My father also said him and my mom did not know what homosexuality was until they came here and learned what it is, saying it with a very negative tone.



Now I've already said on my other posts I am a closet bisexual in a Christian household that is every traditional. I used to pray people see the light and support marriage equality and stop being ignorant and stop hating others the way they are. I couldn't give two shits anymore. I will let fools be fucking ignorant and try to dictate others life, and watch as the LGBT community get more rights and equal treatment, and these homophobic, biphobic, transphobic bastards will be left behind.

While arguments against it are allowed to sling out the same tired cliches and cheery picked, out of context bible verses? Or just random nonsense masquerading as facts.



I don't know if its just me, but i've run into this a fair bit in my fairly short time here on earth. 



One of the most notable examples was during a class i was taking in university. We were supposed to write a short paper(3-5 pages iirc) to invoke change in anything we found unjust in the world.



I chose same sex marriage laws, as coming from canada to the us for school, the whole notion of two consenting adults not being able to marry baffled me.



The paper came back with a B(which i was fine with) and a scribbled note along the lines of ""None of the points made were anything i haven't heard before"".





Sometimes cliches are repeated a lot for good reason.







As a counterpoint, we had discussions in that class about ""the gay lifestyle"" that were just, completely bonkers. 



Other students provided ""Facts"" such as:



""Over 80% of homosexuals use methamphetamine and or Ecstasy on a regular basis.""



""Homosexual men choose to have sex with men because they lack the confidence and testosterone to compete with their manlier counterparts, and settle for whatever they can get""



""All homosexual relationships are based purely in physical desire and lust, which is why monogamy is impossible for ""the gays"" .Once they lost interest in eachother's bodies, they move on to the next partner ""





and everyone listened on baited breath like these were the most compelling, thought provoking arguments against same sex marriage ever.

92,"I always have to change my train of thought whenever I ask myself this question, because it brings extreme shock and upset; how can someone genuinely want to hurt someone else over who they are attracted to? And before, this comes up, we are talking about consenting individuals here. Also, why come society sees it in such casual terms?



I barely see this issue touched upon, even among LGBTQ+ bloggers. Sure, we talk about the unfairness of homophobia (and the other sexuality-related phobias), but we never truly emphasize how sick one has to be to perpetrate acts of violence towards anyone else.",1
93,"The most obvious place where this is true is the genital preference ""debate"" which is not actually a debate and never was. A preference is a preference, but not all preferences are just personal taste. Some are socially instilled prejudices against certain groups. 



In this case against trans people because there are a shit ton of gold stars that despise trans people and the people that date us that happen to identify as gay or lesbian.



In fact, it is almost solely the gold star enforcement group that demean us and the people that date us as ""not true women/men""  and ""not true gays"". 



It's pretty fucking toxic and exists solely to erase trans people. I don't actually care if you feel like repeating this mantra of a ""counter argument"" made to the straw transwoman ""trying to lure lesbians into sex with them and then saying it's transphobia when they don't"" argument is something you say because you actually feel attacked by us.



It's a pretty bad argument on its face as the majority of discussions within the trans community about this are ""it sucks that most people in the gay dating pool won't date a trans person, and it also sucks that there is an extreme subset that actually really fucking hate us"". 





It is really awesome to know the other members of the alphabet soup actually just barely tolerate us and think we are disgusting rapists despite the rhetoric we actually use, our actions etc.

I get that people want to educate, but this isn't ""ask LGBT"" it's ""LGBT"". It's just pretty disheartening to go on an LGBT subreddit as a trans person where only the LGB (and not even always the B) are taken as a given. I come here for news and support and even though they're not the most common posts, I feel like half the time I spend here is feeling obligated to respond to posts calling non-binary individuals crazy or trans women ""really men"". Any other trans folk feel this way? Sorry, just feeling particularly exhausted and dysphoric today. ",1
95,"From when I was a kid, on some level I always knew I was gay. I never felt ashamed of myself or hated myself because of it, which I think is because I knew my family would be loving and accepting. So I had no problem admitting it to myself. 



The only thing I did struggle with (and still do), is being lonely and wanting to experience love and romance. However, I noticed how I'm slowly feeling the burdens of being gay...the struggle of finding other gay men to date, and sometimes I feel like other guys are afraid of being friends with me because they think I will try and hit on them or something. 



When I was younger like in middle school and high school, I was naive and blissful and didn't really think or worry about the negatives of being gay. But now that I'm 24 years old, I'm now feeling some of the burdens. I also tend to over think and overanalyze a lot, so that probably has a lot to do with it. 



I think I'm just tired of feeling different. I know it's something I'm going to have to deal with for the rest of my life, but lately for whatever reason, it's just been getting hard. It's ironic too, since I've always loved to stand out from the crowd and take ownership of my individuality, and I still do. I love celebrating individuality and diversity. But at the same time, I think 'being different' is starting to take a toll on me. 



Maybe because I need to find some other LGBT friends again. Maybe because I'm lonely due lack of friends in general, lack of a boyfriend, and distant from family due to stupid drama and such. I moved away to college a few years ago, hence why I don't have many nearby friends and family. 



Sometimes I think that I should've struggled with this at an earlier age, come to terms with it, and moved on as much as I could. I don't feel like I intentionally ignored these feelings when I was younger, because I genuinely didn't feel them.

I'm a lesbian, and the attention makes me super uncomfortable and I just want it to stop. They seem like nice boys, but they can't take no for an answer. I want to come out, but my family is very conservative and wouldn't accept me. Idk what to do now.",1
99,"I'm currently 23. When I was 15 years old I started realising that I liked girls. I started freaking out because I felt like I now can't like men anymore. I calmed down and got introduced to a word bisexual. I've identified with that, but the word just doesn't feel right. So now I just go by queer. 



At 16 I got my first girlfriend. She was my first kiss and my first everything. I got pretty involved with the lgbt community then. I went to my first pride parade, I was vocal about the cause and attended an lgbt camp twice. We broke up after a while. And I moved away. I haven't dated much but when I did it was mostly men. It's was just easier. It was a new city, I didn't know anyone, and due to my interests, most of my friends were male. 



Ever since then, I don't really feel much like a part of the community anymore. Not because I don't want to, but because of how everyone looks down on me because I'm in a ""straight"" relationship. I love my boyfriend. But that doesn't erase my identity. I can't remember how many times I got snarky remarks on the internet or where ever when I start talking about lgbt while being in a relationship with a man. Bi-erasure is a huge thing, and not only by straight people calling us nonexistent, confused or telling us it's a phase but within the lgbt too - excluding people when they're not dating the same sex, where big part of the community won't even date us because they are biphobic.



Not to mention how livid people get when I just ironically say ""lol i'm so gay"". Everyone talks about gay rights, gay marriage.. Everyone uses gay as an umbrella term nowadays anyways. So why can't I use the word that the lgbt community forced on me, and uses it all the time to describe me?



I don't know. Reddit might be more accepting of this. But maybe I've just had bad experience everywhere else. I just wanted to rant because I keep getting treated like I don't fit anywhere anymore.



Maybe just to end this on a positive note, I was in Stockholm during my vacation which just fell on the time of Pride Week there. It felt nice. There were flags and people and events everywhere. In general it does feel nice because all of this is getting to be more accepting everywhere. ",1
100,"The reason I ask is because I've had a serious drinking problem my whole adult life. 30 year old male now. I've been to counseling, I've been to AA, nothing helps and the more I try to quit the worse it gets.



Well around 2012 I had a bit of a revelation about myself, and that's that I don't really identify as male. I'm never truly happy unless I'm with a woman, but my behavior and mannerisms always come off as more feminine, which in turn scares straight girls away and leads me to take up alcoholism.



Anyways, once I had this revelation about myself was when my drinking really took a turn for the worst. That was when drinking on the weekends started turning into daily self medicating. I've tried talking to several people throughout the years, but I live in rural Ohio. The responses I get range from indifference to straight up anger. The topic of gender identity is a very, very touchy subject and most people around here flat out hate the existence of transgender people.



So yeah, that sucks. Lots of self medicating. I'm looking at AA meetings and see a LBGT one tonight, wondering if maybe that's the place for me? But then I'm wondering if I'm even part of that community, like are they gonna be like ""no you're too straight to be here""?



Basically can a person who looks and acts 100% heterosexual in public be part of the LGBT community?",1
101,"I live in the U.S. and used to work for a *U.S. Company* (I thought I would retire from this company eventually).  This U.S. hi-tech company , recently sold off a division to a partner that is an *India based company*. As a result, I am now an employee of this company and I'm very concerned because I'm LGBT (in the closet) and I have no idea how cool this company is with this. And so I fear for my job, even though I'm a great employee and I rock my job *I'm in stealth and no body knows*.



Because of all that has happened, I have no trust at all in companies or what management tells people. Its gone, and regardless of how awesome I am.  I don't feel like I'm protected by any state or US laws anymore.

102,"Not that I have a problem with my sexual orientation or being black. But my fellow blacks do not understand the LGBT community, and you feel like you must pick a side. No offense to anybody, but these bold words did not appear in thin air. Being black, male, and Queer is so hard.







People do not understand the basic concept of intersectionality. You can be black and be LGBT. So what do the pretend-to-be-pro blacks have to say about that? If you want to unify black people, then accept all people and stop pretending as if your black brothers and sisters are not LGBT also. And we already have to deal with the racism, apply your heterosexual/cisgender privelege and it  leads to black ON black isolation, as if our community is not divided politically yet.  We have Darksins vs. Lightskins, Black men vs. Black Women, the youthful rebels vs. The stereotype defying graduates, and gay black people vs straight black people, full black people vs

biracial black people. ��







It is okay to pull an Offset and use gay slurs, because the Queer community does TOO much? Why should we accept their lifestyle�� /s. This is self contradictory because when Kylie Jenner wears breads or does her jacket in a way Latino women typically wear theirs, she is cyberbullied into the ground, and she is just 20 yrs old. If a black man says he prefers non black women(which is sadly far too common), he is a coon and other vintage slurs. All blacks must agree that cultural appropriation is satanic and All Lives Matter is racist in order to luv themselves. But to say ""I do not vibe with Queers"" in a rap song is perfectly fine. Everything is fine when you do not feel insulted, when you are not being degraded, but when it is ""the gays and transgenders"", them asking for respect is forcing their unacceptable preferences?







Some of your best friends are LGBT, and you do not know because they would be cut off for coming out. It becomes worse when you are a gay MAN. There is a culture of respect and stereotypical masculinity with black people, so gender bending is bad, but even worse when it is a man loving other men and wearing make up etc. The same with religion and LGBT intersectionality. Did we forget that that too is a thing folks?







While religion needs severe work on human rights issues. Many LGBT ppl firmly believe in spiritual entities, and feel conflicted when they hear their kind bash Christians, Muslims, Mormons etc. as a whole. I hear stories of LGBT people treating other LGBT people like aliens for believing in a God. And I felt the same also, back when I waa a Christian.







I feel like the black community screwed ourselves over by being so divisive. We can't get along, because we refuse to love ourselves and the differences between each other. I may be part of the problem, but I am not racist or hateful towards any type of black people. 



Men(White, Black etc) can be feminists and support #Me Too



Christians can be Queer.







Queer people are not just flamboyant white men, they are all diverse and beautiful no matter their differences or racial make up. But it is very hard fighting a battle within yourselves. Which is why I love BLM activist Deray McKesson for being a strong black man with LGBT pride.







If a white man can't say ""N**ga"" and cry out ""Oh, that is how me and my friends adress each other"", then all heterosexual people and cis gender people should stop calling LGBT people too politically correct. You know the reaction if it were you that they were talking about.��

105,"I was raised in a Mormon family, but never felt strong ties to this religion. I wonder, though, if my aversion to being a lesbian is based on the fears that Mormonism causes... excommunication from the family, belief in your trip to Hell, belief that you are the reason for the apocolypse... but I digress. I realized I had backed away from being lesbian every time because of the fear that I would lose my entire family. I did it backwards: in order to get myself to cling to a relationship with a woman I decided to come out first, to get rid of that fear. 



Well, fear is fully justified. I have a large family and it seems that every one of them LOVES me, ... but... 



Immediately after coming out I found out that the church had chosen this time in my life to take it's stance against me and mine. Gay people are loved by the church, as long as they don't act on these feelings. People in gay marriages are not allowed in the church, and horrifyingly, children of gay married parents are not allowed in and may get back in when they turn eighteen and disavow their parents' marriage. If you know more about the church you realize that if you want full blessings of the church you also need to marry the wrong gender, not just take your vow of chastity. My family believes that should I marry I should be ok with them believing that I can live in eternity with them and shun my wife and cast her off to outer darkness or I can go out there with her. 



The difficulty is in the ""love"" that they offer me. I can never explain to them that dehumanizing me and claiming undying love is wrong. They believe it so deeply into the depths of their souls. I am a writer at heart, and I have sent long, beautifully scripted, detailed descriptions of the torture I feel inside and explained why believing that my existence will cause an apocolypse is hurtful to me. I have brought of teen suicides in Utah following this repulsive statement by the church. I have spoken of hours of late night tears. I have explained to them that if I had similar beliefs about their happiness, love, and legal right to marry what it would feel like. All reply with, ""we love you Sarah"", ""you are being a drama queen"", ""you can't see that we're trying"", and I have given up. I'm just not sure how to tell them goodbye, or if I just need to tell them I need a year off from the relationship, or, idk, I don't even know what I feel. I just know that when they offer to visit I feel fiercely ill and repressed and I don't want to have anything to do with them anymore. If I am crying on the floor can't someone respond lovingly rather than telling me how I could fix it and how it's my own fault?

106,"Hi there,



I wanted to share this with you. Something I’m sure you all experienced at some point and also because I’m so disappointed with my coworkers now.



I was finishing lunch (I work in a restaurant) with a bunch of people from my work when I mentioned that today is my best friend’s birthday and that we would go to a Japanese restaurant - leaving on the side these comments. One of the woman from the kitchen said to me: ‘Enjoy the evening with your girlfriend’ and I answered to her: ‘Oh, it’s my best friend’s birthday I didn’t say girlfriend’. She insisted about the girlfriend so I came out. I must say she is like 45-50 and I believe she was the only one who didn’t know I was gay. Then everything was oddly stupid.



‘Have you ever tried a woman?’ I answered her gently I didn’t have to try anything I was born like this and women are not food for you to try and decide if you like them or not and I asked her: ‘how can you know you’re not into women either if you’ve never been with one?’ And she said: ‘I don’t need to try, I know I like men’ and I finished the conversation with: ‘Then it works the same with me’.



After that, I was very disappointed because no one who knew I was gay didn’t say a word to support me or defend me. They even found funny when I was asked if I had ever tried girls. 



When this woman from the kitchen left, two of my coworkers said to me that I should excuse her cause she is old and she has a very different culture from us. Funny thing when I’m from Spain - currently living in a London and they are from different countries as well. I said I was tired of excusing people by their age, we all grow up and learn to see the world differently. Our truth may be someone else’s lie. After that, one of my friend said that anyway no child should have two dads or two mums and in that moment I exploded. I answered that what she was saying was completely bullshit. A child shouldn’t learn about gender rules, fuck al that pink stuff for girls and boy don’t cry. Fuck all that toxic masculinity that we don’t need, it’s 2018. Boys and girls should be raised equally and received love and a good education, that’s it. That’s al they need to be good people.



I’m sorry I’m just disappointed and wanted to share my story. Sorry for all the say and answer. I truly need some more verbs. What do you do in these situations? Because after all that I tried with them I don’t think I could change their point of views in any way.

107,I'm a 15 year old guy. My Father and Mother are divorced and they're both christians. I was struggling with my sexuality for years and I've come to terms now. I'm bisexual.

108,"Now, as I say this take in mind that I'm 16 yo so I've no idea if this happens later or in university; but I'm actually pretty shocked at the total lack of lectures or just general education about sexuality and its many different types. I haven't had one talk about sexuality throughout my life, and I've had to figure it out by myself or by going through sites like this online.



Time and time again it comes up in the news that kids even younger than me have either been hugely discriminated against by their peers and gone into a form of depression or even attempted suicide: and I think the utter absence of any sexuality education in schools certainly up to and maybe beyond my age definitely has something to do with that. Kids like me who were/are currently struggling with their sexuality are so liable to feeling confused and alone because it seems to them like they're not normal.

There's plenty of sexual health etc lectures and talks, but no sexuality talks which are a vital part of someone's identity? Doesn't make sense to me.

109,"Hey, so I am a 21 yo bi male. I came out to my parents and siblings a couple months ago but have been having a really hard time fully coming out, so I figured a good way to start was joining a community like this!



So, story time! I had never told anyone before telling my parents, I was kind of a late bloomer in that sense. Once I  actually decided to tell them and started planning it, I thought it would end up being kind of anticlimactic... after all this time I'm just going to tell them? I dont know what I was expecting, but it felt boring. I knew they would be supportive though, so I had zero concerns. But, when I actually tried to tell them, it was a lot harder then I thought it would be. I am not a very emotional person, but damn did I ever get emotional. They took it great, but I guess contrary to what I thought going in, they didn't know before hand. They are observent people, so I figured they would have known since childhood. Nope. Anyway, telling my siblings went on without a hitch.



However, I have had such a hard time coming to terms telling everyone else. I am so ready to just be out, the idea of people knowing sounds great to me! But every time I think about telling people, all i can think of are awful things that they might think about me. I dont want to be the queer one in the family, and all I can think of is how my extended family will try to look at my past actions for clues. Looking back there are a lot of things they could think of, but a lot of them were just me being a kid, completely unrelated. I dont like having attention on me, and having people give so much attention to me and my past freaks me out.

It didn't work out between she and I. It was long distance, and she was just as new to this as I was--we decided to part ways. But now I'm sort of just sitting around with this profound truth about myself finally reckoned with, and I'm not entirely sure what to do with it. I live in this small town, I work at a small Catholic school that could legally fire me if they found out, and my parents--well, they're whatever the opposite of supportive would be. They're fire and brimstone kind of people. It was a whole thing. But I did come out to them, and most of my friends. 



The gist is: what now? I mean, I just feel pretty low in terms of resources for support, I guess, and so I'm turning to Reddit, which seems questionable but...here we are. Any advice or insight that might be out there--I'm open to it. I guess I'm especially at a loss as to how to even meet other women. Like--obviously I can't just be like, ""Hey--you're cute, are you gay, too?"" 



I mean--that wouldn't work, right? Right.",1
114,"I recently came out as bisexual to a couple of close friends, and they spread the word like the fucking plague. Now everyone at school looks at me funny and a couple of select assholes scream faggot as I walk to my locker. I feel like hiding under my bed and crying for the rest of my life with a bag of goldfish and reddit.

Thanks for all the support, guys, I'm feeling a lot better now.",1
115,"I'm in high school, got lots of good friends, good family, ect. And I'm also a closeted homosexual. Most of my friends would never talk to me again if I do come out and my family will just have some hard emotions to deal with. So none of that motivates me to come out. There's this guy on my hockey team that I like (sexually) and he might be gay/bi(?). He seems very confused and it's a long story. Anyways, If I did come out of the closet, he would just shut me out because he wouldn't want to be seen with me. So again another reason not to come out.",1
116,"Sometimes it's so hard being in the LGBTQA+ community because it's like everything is changing so much and you have to stop and wonder if it really is for the best? Like people have started to shut others out and making people feel excluded. You never know what’s okay or not okay to say because it's like people are too sensitive; like I hate to say that but it's true. Then you just have so many different views in the community on who does and who doesn’t belong in the community.

You have some people yelling at people for using the terms homosexual and queer because they're 'slurs' is too much; especially when people feel comfortable with identifying with those terms. How are queer kids supposed to be comfortable with themselves when people within the community that is supposed to be a safe place for them keep acting like they are now? Especially when you're confused the easiest thing to do is to say you're queer if you're just not quite sure where you fall on anything but you know you're not straight or cisgender. But then people treat that word like a slur and they don't know what to identify as, they can't just say gay because it feels restricting. What are they supposed to identify as, other? They want to say that so many things are dehumanizing but what are they leaving open for options? 

People claim that homosexual is a slur, like I understand that gay people are often sexualized by some teenage girls with their ships and cisgender heterosexual men with their lesbian porn, but like saying homosexual isn't sexualizing them. Then you have the same people who say homosexual is a slur use the term bisexual, where all over the internet and in real life most people only acknowledge bisexual people when they're trying to say that they don't actually exist and that they need to choose a side or when they're interested in using them in threesomes, they're sexualized so severely but you don't see a bunch of bisexuals saying that you can't say bisexual because it sexualizes them.

Then you have people saying that some people don’t belong in the community; especially with asexuals and aromantics, they're a minority and definitely belong in the community. People won't acknowledge their struggles and it's sad because I've seen the struggles and experienced some of the struggles, having many friends who identify as asexual and I myself at one point in my life identifying as asexual. How can you ignore people telling these people it’s just a phase, directing rape jokes at them, saying that they’re heartless, and so many other cruel and dehumanizing things? Those who identify as both asexual and aromantic are seen like less of a human just because they aren’t sexually or romantically attracted to people and for some reason that must mean they’re broken or there’s something wrong with them. What are they supposed to do when no one will accept them? 

Let’s not forget that certain parts of the community act like they have more say in the community that others and it's disgusting. What I have to say to that is that do not act like you have more say in a community that I am equally apart of because you feel like you 'have more struggles'. We all have struggles and though some of them may be different does not make them any less of a struggle. At this rate the community is going to end up falling apart. I’m aware that I’m only lightly touching on this subject, not even touching on genders, but even leaving that out there are so many issues. I could go on how there are issues with how people are willing tell someone that they’re not the gender the identify as because they don’t look like that gender and how some white people in the community like to think they’re better that the people of color in the community, but with all the issues that’d take quite a while to even touch on some of the subjects. These are all serious problems though.

I hope you take what I have said into consideration; this has been a public service announcement from your local transgender bisexual boy.

117,"So I've watch Troye Sivan's Blue Neighbourhood Trilogy videos many times but today was the first time in a while and I came across the [Director's Cut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB3rC2axPY0) which has all three videos continuously and new/different clips that weren't in the previously released, separate videos, and it was the first time I watched the video for [Youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAghEq5Lfw). Normally this is not the genre of music I listen to, but because of the Blue Neighbourhood Trilogy videos I came to like the songs, but for some reason today watching the Director's Cut made me feel even more sad and alone--same thing with Youth.



Obviously they're fictional videos, but for some reason today I just feel more alone and hopeless, and even though I keep telling myself I am 99% sure that I am going to be single forever, watching the videos brought some fuel to the relationship flame and made me think about eventually having a relationship, but I am also trying to suppress those feelings because I'm (99%) set on it never happening. I had a couple impulsive suicidal thoughts (ie thoughts lasting for a couple seconds) today and considered making huge changes in my life, but I know that in a few hours or at least when I wake up in the morning I will be back to normal. Despite this, I don't feel like doing anything and just want to lay down and turn my brain off and want to stop feeling like this. Normally when I start to get sad, I distract myself by doing stuff I like to do, but even now I don't have the energy or motivation to do that stuff.

120,"Ugh, fam, I need a hug. Look, I’m an openly gay man, combat veteran Army Ranger, and I’m on national TV every day now as a political pundit repping the Dem counterpoint in mostly all conservative media (they tolerate me cause I’m a vet). I’m used to fighting the good fight, esp behind enemy lines. I had a big eye opener now though to the homophobia among communities of color, even supposed progressives, when I just came off of this national VERY democratic talk show. 



I’ve been in this show before, it’s audience is almost all African American, and I have GREAT synergy with the host and everyone there in the studio loves me and we have great rapport and nothing but respect for one another. Today I was there to talk about national politics, blah blah, but the host gave me an odd intro and said “back in our studio is Robin Biro, a former Obama campaign regional director, a US Army Airborne Ranger Combat vet, who is still fighting every day behind enemy lines on Fox News Channel, but before I start I gotta tell you brother, the last time we had you on I had a HUGE backlash for having you on as a guest because you’re openly gay.” 



Well I handled that swiftly and said, hmm, “well my brothers &amp; sisters in arms never really had a problem with it because I did my job well, and in fact won NCO/year once, so they can get over that, I’m here to talk about X.”  And we moved on and had a GREAT segment, awesome synergy, perfect flow, just great overall.



Then I get home and mind you I’m VERY used to getting hateful mail etc from conservatives etc, but I love riling them up and challenging their preconceptions. What I wasn’t prepared for though were my own “progressive dems” of color doing that to me with blatant homophobic slurs and rants. I mean my gosh, it was an eye-opener to say the least. I was sent to this show by the Dem party today to represent this event that we are having, and they had my back, but it was just almost shocking to me &amp; I had to say to party leadership that maybe I’m not the best person to be representing if the audience can’t see past my sexuality. They had my back and still want me as a regular, but idk it just felt bad. Like made me think back to being ridiculed in school kinda thing, by my own. I just had really taken for granted the homophobia that still exists among communities of color, well, especially here in the south I suppose. 



Big hugs to my LGBT+ friends of color, the fight continues cause we are nowhere near where we need to be. Much love and respect to each and every one of you for being brave enough to live your lives authentically.  What an eye-opener, but I’m glad for it. ",1
121,"Today like a lot of other days, I felt slightly down due to the fact I live in a very isolated part of the country with a non existent LGBT+ community. It's pretty lonely to not have any LGBT+ pals to talk to and makes me really worried I'm going to end up alone. Dating and meeting new people is hard in more rural areas anyway, however when you're LGBT+ it seems significantly harder to find other LGBT folk or people to meet or date. I was wondering if anyone else feels like this or has any experience of being LGBT+ in a rural/isolated area? ",1

Me: 30, lesbian, married to a man. Wants out of marriage. Tried talking to husband about it, he's in serious denial. He goes from thinking it's funny to thinking it's an ""excuse"" to end the marriage (which I guess means it's not a good enough reason to him? Honestly I don't get it but whatever.). He says things like ""I don't care if you sleep with girls but no men!"" As if I'm asking him for an open marriage or something. He doesn't get it. My parents are homophobic and my dad is actually violently misogynistic so I can't talk to them.



(Trigger, sexual assault) I'm avoiding all intimate contact with my partner at the moment. Last night he woke up in the middle of the night and reached over me to open a window, and I screamed ""NO! PLEASE DONT!"" because I thought he was going to rape me. It was just an impulsive reaction, it's not something I fear in my daily life with him. I'm just really coming to a breaking point with this.



Does anyone have advice for getting my husband to accept this and explain it in a way that makes sense to him? 



Also, does anyone have advice about coming out ""later"" in life? I feel very alienated from mainstream LGBT+ culture because I wasn't out in adolescence. I feel very alone. 



I know I should probably just dump the guy straight up and then get therapy, but I really need help getting to a place mentally to do that. Any insight is really appreciated. I'm scared.

123,"I've decided to bring this up as It's just been my three-year anniversary of coming out and the current debate about same-sex marriage in Australia. 



Around my 8th birthday, I first realised that I was gay. I mean I always found my male action figures to be captivating but that was the period when I knew. I first attempted to come out then. But, chickened out soon after. I cannot remember why but I didn't Over the 6ish years I sat on my sexuality. During these years, I always felt my sexuality was a deep secret that shouldn't be uttered. I never why until I after I came out. During this time, my mother loved to watch soap operas on TV. Well, this soap opera had two men together. In one episode they kissed. 

""Ew, "" She screamed. before looking around for people to laugh and join her. No one did. That was a pattern that I noticed. Eventually, I discovered my mother was a narcisisst and during one pretty big argument, I finally couldn't hold it in anymore. I told her. Silence soon followed. She then said nothing when I asked her if she still loved me. She soon left the room and spoke to her best friend and next door neighbor. She proclaimed to them that she was fine with it but I knew she wasn't. Her temper went through the roof with me. Occasionally she did tell me it was a mistake on coming out. She'd then pass it off as a joke. But, she never truly cared for me after that. A few months later she left my father, my brother and my life. In April last year, I finally came out on facebook. Thankfully, I got nothing but praise. However, I soon learnt she heard of it. Congrations. Was all she said. 



The reason I said all of this is because it doesn't matter what your family think. It's your life and if you find happiness in the arms of another man or women, go for it. You love who you love, not who your parents love. Be happy in who you are and not what other people think.",1
124,"Hi r//lgbt, drunken rambling incoming, I've had these feelings for a while now, since I am on antidepressants, that women are seeming less attractive and men are seeming more attractive. Now I'm not saying that my sexuality is being changed, I might have always been this way. I just recently told my friends about this, and they were incredibly supportive, I am just worried that I am not actually bi and that I am wrong. I am not looking for answers, just to talk, thanks y'all, this supportive community y'all have going is great. Amen",1
125,"follow up to my last post about being a feminine trans guy, rn I'm considered a lesbian and genderfluid. I feel more like a guy and when I do I like guys and girls. When I feel like a girl I only like girls. I'm slowly coming to terms that maybe I'm a trans boys but I still like girls....and like as a trans boy I'd still like to have a gf but I don't think a girl would date a feminine trans boy. Or would they? Pls help",1
126,"So this is kind of the story of how I realized I'm Bi. I think I spent most of middle school, really insecure. I had friends who would get girlfriends and I know those relationships dont matter, but that's not the point. I had never heard of girls finding me attractive. In fact I had heard ""Ewws"" around my mention. So then in 8th grade finally someone who liked me. Me and this girl dated for nearly a year, and actually got sexually active (lucky me right?). Well here's where i started questioning. I knew she was Bi pretty early on. Well I found out she had been cheating on me with another girl. At this same time, I'm using MeetMe to find friends from elementary school. Well a few days later, a guy messages me. He opens with ""hey youre cute"". This is the first time I had gotten male attention, at least like that. He and I talked for a few days, and I explained how my gf was sleeping around with an ex-gf of hers and I didnt know how to feel. Somehow we get around to me ""getting even with her"" by doing something with a guy. So we ended up trading dick pics. Not my proudest moment. But when I looked at his penis, all I could think is ""Thats hot"". So for a little while I was ""Bicurious"". Then the girl dumped me near thanksgiving, found out she was cheating on me again with a guy who tried to beat her. The way she said it was pretty brutal as well ""You are an unlovable tiny dick bitch"" or something of those lines. But yeah I was down in the dumps though. I started sending dick pics to random guys. But thankfully I decided to stop. It was late january and I started talking to the girl again, and we dated for nearly a month. This time Im pretty sure she wanted dick cuz after I fucked her she got super distant. She dumped me again. But this time I refrained from sending dick pics. I started watching Gay Porn. Still unsure since I never met a guy Im attracted to. For awhile I labled myself Heteroflexible (Im straight but shit happens). Then I helped start a gamers club and ran it for the most part. This put me in contact with lots of guys. I remember someone moved here from england, and he was kinda ugly, but he joined. Then one day he dragged in his older brother. And that was the moment I knew I was Bi. I dont think I'll tell him that, but he does know Im attracted to him. But I was still in the closet then. I spent most of my high school time there. Then there was this beautiful girl one day during my Junior year. Me and her became friends (and now we're dating). I remember me and her talked about sexualities and she said she was Biromantic. She graduates, I dont. We grow a lil distant besides the occaisional meme. Then one day she asks me out to see Deadpool, and that month after that we both liked each other, and then we're going out. Knowing her, I figured she could be the first person I can tell. It's late night thursday. I tell her Im Bi. She gets excited since I finally came out to someone. I came out to my friends and even to my followers on Tumblr. Then I find out my sister stalks my tumblr and knows. I never wanted her to know since she stated her whole life she wanted a gay brother for stereotypical reasons. I dont really plan on telling my family at all. I told the one person I knew I was comfortable with telling to find out my sister told her. I still worry if my sister outted me or not.

Yesterday I told my mom it was hard to talk to her because she was so close minded. She was confused because when I was younger we were really close. I asked if she loved me. She said yes. I asked her if it was unconditional. She said of course because I'm her youngest child. I asked: hypothetically speaking, what if I was gay, would you still love me no matter what? She said are you gay? I said no, but what if I was, would you still love me the same. She said I'd pray for you. At this point I was frustrated because I wanted to know how she would honestly react if I told her I was trans, but she wouldn't answer the questions properly!



I told her: If anything that would make me even more suicidal.

She asked me if I was suicidal and I answered yes. She was really quiet and was thinking a lot. 



She asked if I was gay, I told her no. I told her ""It's hard talking to you because you are so close minded and insensitive to certain topics. I don't want to lose you because you are all I have and I don't want you to hate me. You always choose religion over me and I don't know if you would kick me out for being something you don't condone. I don't want to be alone, I want you to accept me. I can't stand to think that you would be disgusted at me and kick me out or whatever.""



She kept guessing ridiculous things for what I might be and she never guessed trans. She asked when did this start and I said 10 years old. That threw her off entirely. She said if she wanted me to visit a therapist so she could understand more of why I was so depressed. I refused to go to a Christian-based therapist and she said okay. 



She said she was going to book an appointment to one that wasn't religious as hell and I made sure the therapist was someone young and who would have a better understanding of what I'm going through. 



She's still guessing what I could possibly be, but I'm waiting until we go to the therapist so I can tell her from start to finish.



Can you guys reassure me that I am doing the right thing here? She really wants to understand how I'm feeling. She said she would never kick me out and she isn't violent whatsoever.

I am a 23 year old gay guy. Homo-romantic at the least. When it comes to intimacy with my partners, I love to hold hands and sensually touch, kiss, and love cuddling, even naked cuddling. But when it comes to the actual sexual intercourse, I hate it. I can not think of a sexual encounter that I have enjoyed. Orgasming, for me, has always been a chore in the presence of other people. It's difficult, and I also don't enjoy touching the other person in any sexual manner. It feels unnatural, I seem to displace myself from the event and can never just be ""in the moment."" But I do find men sexually attractive and masturbate regularly. I find men sexually appealing. But when it comes to real sex, I have never enjoyed it.



Asexuals, do find anyone sexually attractive? There are certainly people that turn me on, but I know if I were to actually have sex with them I would hate it. 



I've been seeing a guy for over a year and he gets extremely frustrated because I only work up the courage to touch him sexually (its not even actual sex in the end) about once every 2 weeks. It makes me feel defective but it also makes me very mad and resentful because I feel like every time he touches me there are sexual undertones. I want to touch him and be *sensual* but not sexual, if that makes any sense...



Am I Asexual? Or it is sexual anxiety/performance anxiety?

Recently, I've been feeling very down about my identity.

But I don't think I can throw the time into proper research and all that right now, and it grates so much. And I'm scared I'll die alone, and... well. All of it just piles up and throws me into spirals of feeling horrible.



I mean, people tell me not to let it affect me, but that's like telling someone to put on a bulletproof vest to not get killed by the bullets, and then not handing him the vest? So I'm just wondering if any of you have practical strategies for dealing with things like this - like, ways to avert the thought processes that go down bad paths? Ways to make sure that I can shrug off the little things that set off these moods, so I don't end up falling into those spirals. I know everyone's different, and different strategies work for different people, but I figure I may as well try a few strategies out.



TLDR: Lots of homophobic things in my environment are making me feel shitty, and I'm asking if anyone has practical ways to make sure I can deal with those things instead of fixing on them and ending up feeling like hell.",1
141,"My experiences with queer women have been very limited and ungood, but I only blame myself. It seems like most of my friends are straight males, with some bisexuals, a few transwomen, at least one gay man, and one asexual. That’s it. I guess that I desire to atone for my ignorance and the ignorant statements that I’ve made, but most people will probably assume that I just want some to ‘convert’ them or some sick shit.",1
142,"Maybe I'm thinking too hard about this, but I finally figured out why the ""wedding cake"" example that always gets used is so annoying. (You know the one- Jon and Steve are getting married and want to buy a cake. The baker refuses to sell them a wedding cake because she doesn't support their sexuality. Yadda yadda.)



I know it's based on an actual event, which gives it some tangibility, but it's also something that isn't threatening at the level that FADA could be. When I ~~am~~ worry about FADA, I worry about not being able to get housing with my fiance, losing a job, not being able to get medical care because of my trans history - things that are much more vital and pressing than cakes. 



This isn't to say that the cake example/incident isn't still demeaning and horrible, but it's a bad example to use when talking to anyone who doesn't get why FADA is a problem.



What's you all's take on this?

143,"So I’ve known for a while that I’m not fully female. I was born female but I currently identify as nonbinary (I’m gay if that helps anything lol) I’ve just lately been so confused as to whether I’m a trans guy or just nb.



I’ve always envisioned life as being a lot better as a guy? Like I hate my period more than anything, and I’d much rather have a dick. I wanna do things that are considered traditionally ‘masculine’ without having people look at me weird for it. I know it’s not a gender related thing but I cannot stand wearing dresses, skirts, aka presenting myself as more ‘feminine.’ I like wearing cologne more than perfume, and I try + myself talk in a lower voice. I feel like just everything would have been better in life if I were a guy. I’d be a straight male and I wouldn’t be ridiculed for being gay, and I wouldn’t have to listen to my mom telling me to ‘be a girl for once.’ I don’t want to be a girl.



But at the same time, I don’t like the idea of transitioning. I don’t like my genitals, but i can live with them. I’ve always told myself that I would be happier as a guy, but a biological male.  I have no clue if I could see myself as a trans guy, and I don’t think I’m mentally strong enough for transitioning. Being a ‘girl’ gives me a lot of benefits in society, such as me being a crybaby. When I cry in public, nobody sees me as weird. I’m scared that people would think of me as weak if I were instead a guy being a pussy. 



Sooo, if anyone can help me that would be greatly appreciated, haha. I just wanna make sure I’m not using nb as a temporary term, and if I’m trans I’m gonna have to accept it, which idk if I can.

144,"I try to not dislike religious people, why? I believe in equality and fairness, but the things religious people have done and said about women, and especially gay people is too much. Too hurtful, too stupid.



People like that guy who well deservedly had his house washed up away is one of them, he just represents the people who believe marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman. And that the growing mainstream acceptance is part of a global attempt to reduce the population, because there's too much people. 



I have family members who believe that shit. And I hope they do realize gay people, including closeted people probably don't even come near half of the population. The world would be centuries ahead of now, in order for that to happen. And it's been proven homosexuality is the way you were born. But fuck professionals with acted to their name.





So that's why Ill never understand the higher power agenda bullshit, no proof or logic.

145,"At work today we had a diversity inclusion type event where they ask a question and you go to the center of the room if it applies to you. This is meant to help people see that they have more in common with some people than they thought, and also that people they thought were just like them might have differences. Some of the questions were light hearted, like do you like to dance or do you have pets. But then they asked if anyone was LGBT and for reference this is in the Bible Belt at a company owned by publicly very conservative people. It's not a topic that comes up often and I'm afraid to be out at work. When they asked that no one else went up, and I was too afraid. It was like a blacked out for a second, my ears were ringing. I feel guilty for not representing my community and for allowing others here at work to continue thinking all employees here are straight and narrow. I wish I could be vocal and proud but I'm just afraid. I'm new in my career and who knows if I would be treated differently or held back for it.

146,"so here's my issue



i am 24 years old and have not yet come out of the closet

i am basically living my life how i want without having announced that im gay



i like all of the ""stereotypical gay things""

i dress better than most straights haha

i am an avid public supporter of all things LGBTQ+ 



anyway i am ready to tell everyone and just be done with it

the thing that is stopping me is that i feel i owe it to my best friend to tell him first

i am worried that for whatever reason this will harm our friendship



the thing that makes this fear irrational is that he is also gay

he has been the one to make me most comfortable with myself and made me accept myself for who i always have been



the reason i think i am afraid to tell him is because ive kept it from him for 2 years now and feel like i should have said something from day 1



the reason i didnt is because when we first met he was in a relationship with an asshole who didnt want him to have male friends and refused to let him have gay friends

i choose to stay quiet because id rather stay in the closet and be friends than come out and lose him



part of me thinks he already knows but just hasnt said so

he will make comments about how people need to come out on their own time and things like that

ive been on the verge of telling him numerous times but have always backed out of doing it



the reason im writing this is because i wondered what others would do in my situation because im sure this happens all of the time 

and also wonder what others would think if their best friend of 2 years kept this hidden and just now said something about it



any and all advice is welcome

148,"So, I was browsing a website from a transgender woman who is post-transition. 



She posted articles and opinions on her website that the driving force behind some trans women is homosexuality and that some homosexual men become women to be able to be with straight men. She even used examples like, I quote : "" the shemales in Brazil who revert to being gay men after their looks fade "". 

And saying things like "" SRS is only one step further once they end up in a relationship with a straight man "".



As far as I know she is a lesbian. I myself am a straight trans woman and for some reason I felt like she was saying that many straight trans women became women to be able to sleep with straight guys. Which came off as kind of hurtful. 



Is this kind of superiority behavior from her? Where does it come from? ",1
149,"There are some guts some people get, some kind of liver they carry that makes me wonder if we're all in this same homophobic, gay-hating country of Nigeria together. 



A few days ago, I was at the mall to see a movie with a friend. I got to the mall before her so I decided to wait for her in Cold Stone. The mall these days fa, no waiting area for free o. Wherever you sit, you must buy from them or else their security will come shoo you away. I wanted to have ice cream anyway, so I bought Cold stone and settled into a booth, reading my Shopaholic novel while slurping through my ice cream. 



Then this nice-looking guy approaches my booth from the counter. He's just bought his own ice cream and very politely asks to share my table with me. I found him asking very nice and odd as well, becos I hadn't colonised the table. He could've just sat without having to ask me. And it wasn't the 'I'd like to sit please' kind of asking. It was the 'can I please share your table' kind, complete with a pause, as though he was waiting for me to give my permission first. 



I said Sure, and he sat. I was barely even disturbed by his getting settled at the table. 



So there we were, going through our ice cream and reading books. He'd brought out a book to read too. 



It wasn't long before I felt his foot brush against mine under the table. Without thinking anything about it, I moved my leg away. Seconds later, his leg made contact again. This time, I reckoned he was looking for leg space, so again I moved mine out of the way. Then the third time was a more deliberate motion: he actually brought his leg and placed it halfway on top of mine. 



Startled, I looked up at him. He caught my eye and winked. My brethren, my instant panicked thought was: Chimooo! They have come to get me in Cold Stone. 



I was almost done with my ice cream by this time, so I kuku hastily scooped up the few remaining mouthfuls, dumped my book in my bag and fled. 



It wasn't until I was on the escalator heading upstairs to the cinema that I entertained the thought that perhaps he was just a thirsty gay man with a good gaydar who'd zoned in on me and was just trying to get something started. 



But then, when you've lived and listened to and even escaped many horror stories, paranoia becomes your first instinct when a stranger possibly flirts with you.",1
150,"Throw away for obvious reasons.



I fully transitioned MtF starting a long time ago. I actually started transitioning in second grade, have been on HRT since my teens, and live in stealth (this information becomes relevant later).



All my identification documents match my current status. Name changed over a decade ago. This includes my social security card, driver's license, etc. The only document I could never get updated was my birth certificate because that state does not acknowledge that my sex status has changed.



Because trans-related stuff does not play a large role in my day to day life I was out of loop in knowing that a couple years ago the Obama Admin issued an executive order forcing the State Department to issue correct passports even to people whose birth certificates contain information that does not match their current status (whether that be their name or sex status).



When I learned that I had a light bulb moment of ""Great! Now I can get a passport that is accurate, so that any time I move to another state I will have enough correct-identification forms to avoid having to out myself under the RealID Act while in DMV lines!""



If your passport, social security card, and current driver's license all match you don't have to show the DMV your birth cert &amp; name change court order.



A passport also lasts 10 years so I would have an iron-clad ID to use should things change dramatically under the next president.



So I go to get a passport and that's where everything started to unravel. First, the places that usually issue passports like the Post Office don't know how to deal with this scenario and are willing to issue me a passport but only an incorrect one since my birth certificate states what it does. State Department says to go to a US Passport Agency then. Okay.... I make an appointment with the nearest one which is in Philadelphia.



The phone system, which was purely automated and had no humans I could talk to, kept making warnings that I needed to have travel arrangements already made to use their office. I don't have any travel plans. But since this is literally the only place that seems capable of handling my passport application I made an appointment anyway.



Get to my appointment this morning. I get through the security check point, get in line, and an employee of the US Passport Agency walks up to me (as she apparently did to everyone) to make sure they had travel arrangements already. I didn't and start to explain my situation. She immediately figures out what the scenario here is and rather than find a quiet office to talk about it, proceeds to (while trying discretely) talk about it in front of a crowded line of other people. All of whom quietly figure out my status and a couple start giggling over it/making fun of me amongst themselves.



She then refuses to let me get in line and refers me to my birth state's vitals department to get my birth certificate updated saying that needs to be done before they can help me with what I want. Which is great except- THEY WON'T DO THAT!



So not only was I denied access, but I was outted to a room full of strangers so that they could be entertained by the situation.



I don't know what to do next. I could go to a civil rights organization like the ACLU but that would out me if they tried to do anything about the process. There are times where I have forgone or delayed emergency medical care to prevent my situation from being exposed to my social circle- I have no interest whatsoever in being paraded in front of the media or court just to get a passport, so unless someone can think of a better idea I guess I will have to go without one.



Besides, if the incoming president follows up on his promises to rescind these types of executive orders time's out now to do anything about it. Its Dec 16, just shy of a month away. If it had to be done it had to be now, and well, now I am screwed.



If it helps anyone think of any discrete ways of handling this I did have a 3rd party impartial witness with me (one of the only people in my life who know about my status- even many of my relatives do not). ",1
151,"i posted about this several times before, but every time i was shut down and silenced. i had a bi person taking away my voice and commencing and making it all about them, because how dare those asexuals to speak up for themselves. i thought maybe for asexual awareness week, asexual people could deserve a basic amount of respect from this so very tolerant community and safe space. every time i talked about this, people started acting like the lgbt+ community is some kind of suffering competition, and asexuals don't suffer enough and therefore don't deserve respect. except you THINK we don't suffer. you THINK you know what it's like  to be ace. but you don't. just because you think we don't go through shit doesn't give you the right to silence us.

152,"So, my first post here....

What I want to ask is does changing location makes it better? I live in central European conservative country ����, so i'm not in situation when I risk being flogged or killed for being queer. On the other hand I feel locked in trap, I can't imagine coming out in place like one I live in, being myself, falling in love or to be frank accepting myself the way I'm. I've seen here people from USA out and proud though they're from conservative region/community or ultraconservative family. I've seen here people from latin America, Arab countries, India and so on all out and proud. So I know that location is not always the case. I know that moving to Berlin, London or NYC won't eradicate all of the problems, but does one have to fight where he is or maybe changing location for better place is part of the fight for being myself, for happiness. Did you changed your location, moved to other country?

Today, I came across this gay joke on my feed. https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8ckepz/gay_couple_on_a_plane/?sort=controversial



Even my family and friends will casually make what I think are just really strange jokes about anal sex. I don't think they're funny. They feel like microaggressions.



Unfortunately, I struggle to easily explain to others why I'm against them. I think because they are small jabs at my humanity, rather than overt discrimination, it's easy to be told I'm 'overreacting.' And that really belittles and invalidates my opinions.



It doesn't seem to occur to even well-meaning people that these casual jokes about gay people are put downs. Like it's funny that we're different, or less than, or we're a spectacle for cishets. They accumulate and pile onto my shoulders and damn it all really weighs me down when this behavior comes from people I think are my friends. I really wish I had a succinct rebuttal to defend myself, but I'm always at a loss for words. 



Edit: For example, if we were to sub a straight couple for the gay men in the airplane joke, would it still be funny if the old man objected? If a woman was penetrated for asking for a napkin, the joke would be strange. But a man? Hilarious.",1
