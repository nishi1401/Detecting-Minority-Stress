Recently James Charles has become the first ever male Cover Girl, YouTuber Manny Mua is also now the new face of maybelline.I'm a transgender woman and I'm just wondering why the hell these companies are choosing these extra, white gays as brand ambassadors?this irritates me so much especially when people call it ""inspirational"" and so ""brave"". It really hurts me that this gets recognition, love and support when it's a choice? Unlike being a transgender woman for example you can't take off your makeup and call it a day you need it for security and to be seen as the gender you are rather than the sex you were assigned .

113,"Hi... sorry if this is the wrong place to ask something like this.



I'm 13 male but I know I'm not supposed to be. Ever since I found out how possible it was, I've wanted to get surgery to really become a girl.



I've talked a bit about it to my mum before... but it's not that I'm afraid of.



I am deathly afraid of going to school and having to deal with the way people will react. Part of me wants to wait until I'm out of school to start changing just for this reason... but it just feels awful not being who I really am.



Friends and pretty much everyone make fun of trans... I would be living in a nightmare if I went through with it now.



Please help? What do I do?",1
16,"So recently I started work at my first job in a field related to my degree (woo!) and generally things have been awesome so far. It took a lot of effort to get here, and it's nice to feel like I'm progressing in life.  

But today, I overheard stuff that's making me think twice. I don't even know his name, but I know he's more senior than me and I think he's a team leader for one of the projects but I haven't really had a direct interaction with him other than when he stole my seat from my desk, but I didn't realise that since he wasn't in it when I noticed it had been moved. He yelled at me for taking it back, and that was that.  

But today I heard him make comments which I didn't really like, starting off a Skype call with someone asking if the other person if they were ""Being queer and kissing a lot of men"". Fine, I don't know the context such as if the person on the other end was gay and it was just playful conversation between friends, but even so idk if it's really work appropriate.  

In addition to not knowing the context for sure, he's obviously someone more senior than me, I started at work literally a week ago and I really need this job. I'm scared if I make a comment to HR like I feel I should, I'll get seen as a troublemaker and would paint a target on my back, not just because I'm speaking out but because I'm also pretty much screaming ""Yes, the reason I object to those comments is because I like men and took it a teeny bit personally"". And if he is openly homophobic, what if it's because it's seen as OK here, and outing myself will make a bunch of other people get hostile?  

I don't really know if there's a point to this because I feel like I'm genuinely stuck and need to bite my tongue, but yeah. What should I do?

I came out as trans about a year ago, and hinted it at least 3 years prior, but apparently he ""needs more time"", because I'm ""rushing him"". Bitch you're rushing me, I've practically pubertyed through all of my opportunities to look feminine (thanks by the way), and it's not even YOUR decision. I told him that I had enough, I tried being nice but he pushed me to the edge, so now I'm going to take matters into my own hands and live my own life the moment I'm 18, but then guess what? He blackmails me. He'll fucking take me out of school if I do because I'm ""ruining my siblings lives"". YOU'RE FUCKING RUINING MINE. Ughhhhhh I cant just drop out halfway through year 12, like I actually want to have a job so..? I can go to my mum for this maybe and see if she has a way to keep me in school (pleeease dear god I hope so), but if I do I'll end up living with her and she knows barely anything about me being trans. I've talked to her about wearing makeup and panties but she probs thinks I'm a crossdresser or something, so that could be awkward.

55,"I'm currently 23. When I was 15 years old I started realising that I liked girls. I started freaking out because I felt like I now can't like men anymore. I calmed down and got introduced to a word bisexual. I've identified with that, but the word just doesn't feel right. So now I just go by queer. 



At 16 I got my first girlfriend. She was my first kiss and my first everything. I got pretty involved with the lgbt community then. I went to my first pride parade, I was vocal about the cause and attended an lgbt camp twice. We broke up after a while. And I moved away. I haven't dated much but when I did it was mostly men. It's was just easier. It was a new city, I didn't know anyone, and due to my interests, most of my friends were male. 



Ever since then, I don't really feel much like a part of the community anymore. Not because I don't want to, but because of how everyone looks down on me because I'm in a ""straight"" relationship. I love my boyfriend. But that doesn't erase my identity. I can't remember how many times I got snarky remarks on the internet or where ever when I start talking about lgbt while being in a relationship with a man. Bi-erasure is a huge thing, and not only by straight people calling us nonexistent, confused or telling us it's a phase but within the lgbt too - excluding people when they're not dating the same sex, where big part of the community won't even date us because they are biphobic.



Not to mention how livid people get when I just ironically say ""lol i'm so gay"". Everyone talks about gay rights, gay marriage.. Everyone uses gay as an umbrella term nowadays anyways. So why can't I use the word that the lgbt community forced on me, and uses it all the time to describe me?



I don't know. Reddit might be more accepting of this. But maybe I've just had bad experience everywhere else. I just wanted to rant because I keep getting treated like I don't fit anywhere anymore.



Maybe just to end this on a positive note, I was in Stockholm during my vacation which just fell on the time of Pride Week there. It felt nice. There were flags and people and events everywhere. In general it does feel nice because all of this is getting to be more accepting everywhere. ",1

170,"So I’ve known for a while that I’m not fully female. I was born female but I currently identify as nonbinary (I’m gay if that helps anything lol) I’ve just lately been so confused as to whether I’m a trans guy or just nb.



I’ve always envisioned life as being a lot better as a guy? Like I hate my period more than anything, and I’d much rather have a dick. I wanna do things that are considered traditionally ‘masculine’ without having people look at me weird for it. I know it’s not a gender related thing but I cannot stand wearing dresses, skirts, aka presenting myself as more ‘feminine.’ I like wearing cologne more than perfume, and I try + myself talk in a lower voice. I feel like just everything would have been better in life if I were a guy. I’d be a straight male and I wouldn’t be ridiculed for being gay, and I wouldn’t have to listen to my mom telling me to ‘be a girl for once.’ I don’t want to be a girl.



But at the same time, I don’t like the idea of transitioning. I don’t like my genitals, but i can live with them. I’ve always told myself that I would be happier as a guy, but a biological male.  I have no clue if I could see myself as a trans guy, and I don’t think I’m mentally strong enough for transitioning. Being a ‘girl’ gives me a lot of benefits in society, such as me being a crybaby. When I cry in public, nobody sees me as weird. I’m scared that people would think of me as weak if I were instead a guy being a pussy. 



Sooo, if anyone can help me that would be greatly appreciated, haha. I just wanna make sure I’m not using nb as a temporary term, and if I’m trans I’m gonna have to accept it, which idk if I can.

175,"so here's my issue



i am 24 years old and have not yet come out of the closet

i am basically living my life how i want without having announced that im gay



i like all of the ""stereotypical gay things""

i dress better than most straights haha

i am an avid public supporter of all things LGBTQ+ 



anyway i am ready to tell everyone and just be done with it

the thing that is stopping me is that i feel i owe it to my best friend to tell him first

i am worried that for whatever reason this will harm our friendship



the thing that makes this fear irrational is that he is also gay

he has been the one to make me most comfortable with myself and made me accept myself for who i always have been



the reason i think i am afraid to tell him is because ive kept it from him for 2 years now and feel like i should have said something from day 1



the reason i didnt is because when we first met he was in a relationship with an asshole who didnt want him to have male friends and refused to let him have gay friends

i choose to stay quiet because id rather stay in the closet and be friends than come out and lose him



part of me thinks he already knows but just hasnt said so

he will make comments about how people need to come out on their own time and things like that

ive been on the verge of telling him numerous times but have always backed out of doing it



the reason im writing this is because i wondered what others would do in my situation because im sure this happens all of the time 

and also wonder what others would think if their best friend of 2 years kept this hidden and just now said something about it



any and all advice is welcome

15,"Let me start by saying that I created this thread on another sub but it was absolutely the worst sub to probably post it on so I’m putting it on here. 



So I’m 19, biologically I’m female, but I’m confused af about my gender identity and what that even means. Let me start by giving a background of my identity progression, please bare with me. 



I’m Dominican and Peruvian (I’m also white passing), but I had the privilege of being raised in a relatively accepting household, where my parents (my dad especially) wanted me to be whoever I wanted to be and no one else. With that said, they let me wear whatever I wanted and play with whatever and with whomever I wanted to. Since I was maybe 6 or 7 I dressed in boy clothes and every time I would go shopping I would go straight to the boys section. I loved the clothes and the style and I was most comfortable with that form of dressing. This ended when I finished my 1st year of middle school, I stopped being a “tomboy” because I had a new group of friends. All of my life my best friends had been boys (even in that first year of middle school), but then I became best friends with two girls and their group of friends. They were girly girls, they did their make up, talked about boys, wore clothes from the girls section at hollister and it’s sister stores; basically they were my opposite. I quickly adopted a level of their style and mindset, basically changing myself entirely. I was a little uncomfortable at first but the change was refreshing and didn’t feel off, I was exploring something new and that was okay for me. This really feminine version of me went on until my sophomore year of high school, then I started mixing up my style to be a wee bit more masculine (I began a relationship with my first serious girlfriend and had come out to my school as being pan), it felt right and I was happy with the way I was presenting myself. Claiming my sexual identity was revolutionary and evolved everything about me, including how I presented myself. Now, up until a year or two ago I didn’t question that I was a girl inside. For me, being a girl and going by she/her just meant I had a female anatomy but I could do whatever and be whoever with that. I didn’t consciously or deliberately tie any social implications to the terms. Of course I still had ideas of what it meant to be a girl and what it meant to be a boy, everyone goes through conditioning, but I just viewed myself as me. I still do. 



I know that a lot of this has to do with gender expression, I’ve always felt I could pass as a boy or a girl depending on how I dressed and I like it like that. My confusion is that some days I feel more masculine and other times I don’t, so much so that if I don’t wear clothes that align perfectly with how I’m feeling that day, I’m most likely going to feel anxious, depressed, and generally off-put. I do suffer from depression and anxiety in general but it’s exacerbated those days. I don’t feel like I have to change my body because I have the privilege of having a body that does a pretty good job of appearing however I want it to appear. I think I’m genderfluid, or really just genderqueer to be more broad, but I can’t put my finger on whether that’s a valid assessment. I know everyone has their own definition of what it means to be those things but as a feminist who believes in the ability of people being able to dress/act however they want to and still be cisgendered, how do I know if I am genderqueer? If you are able to remove the social implications of what it means to be a girl and a boy (putting aside the patriarchy and sex-based oppression), does it make a difference if you identify as genderqueer or non-conforming? If yes, what is it exactly that might make us feel that we identify more as a man or a woman (or neither/both) if not the way we are treated by society? 



I really hope this made sense, I know it’s long and my grammar/punctuation isn’t great, and there’s a lot of parentheses but please help! I have sooo many questions and it’s stressing me the fuck out. I feel like I don’t know who I am. I’m okay with not labeling myself because I never really have, but I want to understand as much as possibly because I feel that’s just one more way to be a better human and help others who might be going through a similar circumstance. 



Also please correct me if I’m not using proper terminology or I’m not saying something quite right. ",0
162,"(Forgive the long post, you may as well skip to the TLDR)



Recently, I've been feeling very down about my identity. I'm biromantic homosexual (I like to call it ""functionally gay"", because while I've had short crushes on girls, my feelings for guys are more intense and I can only imagine a future with a boyfriend) and while I know there's nothing wrong with me I just feel very trapped where I am. 



I'm 18. My parents are super religious, and my country is mostly conservative (though my friends are very nice and supportive, so I'm thankful for that).



Anyway, I feel down because of how mucked up the world is for people like us (hate crimes, less rights, etc) and it's just... so *annoying* how heteronormative everything is, and how my mom keeps warning me about ""how corrupt our society is these days"" and about ""men out there who prey on boys"". It just feels like a series of blows to the chest. When my parents talk like this I'm just... reminded that someday I will have to argue with them, that someday there will be a fight, and I'm scared I won't come out on top. I'm choked up because right now I'm positively drowning under my work and stress but I also feel the need to be able to defend me from any arguments? But I don't think I can throw the time into proper research and all that right now, and it grates so much. And I'm scared I'll die alone, and... well. All of it just piles up and throws me into spirals of feeling horrible.



I mean, people tell me not to let it affect me, but that's like telling someone to put on a bulletproof vest to not get killed by the bullets, and then not handing him the vest? So I'm just wondering if any of you have practical strategies for dealing with things like this - like, ways to avert the thought processes that go down bad paths? Ways to make sure that I can shrug off the little things that set off these moods, so I don't end up falling into those spirals. I know everyone's different, and different strategies work for different people, but I figure I may as well try a few strategies out.



TLDR: Lots of homophobic things in my environment are making me feel shitty, and I'm asking if anyone has practical ways to make sure I can deal with those things instead of fixing on them and ending up feeling like hell.",1
60,"I'm 21 year old guy, I hope this is the right place to be posting this. I never really questioned my sexuality until now, I just kept to myself, and became lonely, depressed, whatever. I finally started interacting with people my own age (only child w/ old parents) I don't think I am straight, I can't even say it without smirking, I'm just constantly remembering old stuff and realizing I'm definitely not straight, I don't really know what I am, I don't really like the idea of sex, although I can fantasize about it I can't actually picture myself in that situation. I mean it's only been a week since I came to this conclusion, but the evidence is pretty one sided. I like women a lot, I like being around them and being intimate at times, I just know that I also find men attractive. I just get this warmth and tightness in my chest when I am around people I know, I'm not an alien, I totally understand that is how I feel when I clearly have a crush on someone. 



Anyway, I was wondering if I should go out and tell this person I know who seems nice and discretionary or discussing this with my therapist first. I am leaning towards the latter, I don't want her to tell anyone and I also just realized this about myself. I should probably slow my roll with that right? I want her to know things about me, I like her a lot as a friend, I hear about her life sometimes but I never really share who I am with her. Any advice? I'm super new, but I highly doubt this is a phase. It was one of those things that just clicked, I was just lying in bed and I said ""mhhhhh I don't think that straight people watch this kind of porn, also, why do I keep making eye contact with that guy in lecture, he's really cute."" There's more than two things I thought about but yeah, I am pretty certain I am not gay, but also not straight as per the flooding of old and new memories. Lmao, did any of you like painting your toe and finger nails when you were little? I was pretty obsessed.",0

Look, I’m an openly gay man, combat veteran Army Ranger, and I’m on national TV every day now as a political pundit repping the Dem counterpoint in mostly all conservative media (they tolerate me cause I’m a vet). I’m used to fighting the good fight, esp behind enemy lines. I had a big eye opener now though to the homophobia among communities of color, even supposed progressives, when I just came off of this national VERY democratic talk show. 



I’ve been in this show before, it’s audience is almost all African American, and I have GREAT synergy with the host and everyone there in the studio loves me and we have great rapport and nothing but respect for one another. Today I was there to talk about national politics, blah blah, but the host gave me an odd intro and said “back in our studio is Robin Biro, a former Obama campaign regional director, a US Army Airborne Ranger Combat vet, who is still fighting every day behind enemy lines on Fox News Channel, but before I start I gotta tell you brother, the last time we had you on I had a HUGE backlash for having you on as a guest because you’re openly gay.” 



Well I handled that swiftly and said, hmm, “well my brothers &amp; sisters in arms never really had a problem with it because I did my job well, and in fact won NCO/year once, so they can get over that, I’m here to talk about X.”  And we moved on and had a GREAT segment, awesome synergy, perfect flow, just great overall.



Then I get home and mind you I’m VERY used to getting hateful mail etc from conservatives etc, but I love riling them up and challenging their preconceptions. What I wasn’t prepared for though were my own “progressive dems” of color doing that to me with blatant homophobic slurs and rants. I mean my gosh, it was an eye-opener to say the least. I was sent to this show by the Dem party today to represent this event that we are having, and they had my back, but it was just almost shocking to me &amp; I had to say to party leadership that maybe I’m not the best person to be representing if the audience can’t see past my sexuality. They had my back and still want me as a regular, but idk it just felt bad. Like made me think back to being ridiculed in school kinda thing, by my own. I just had really taken for granted the homophobia that still exists among communities of color, well, especially here in the south I suppose.

I read a lot and work in a bookstore. I always try to research and collect titles by queer people or about queer culture, and decided to only read books of this ilk during 2016. I wanted to share what I've read so far, and would greatly appreciate your suggestions or titles you've read this year too. :)



[Gay Berlin by Robert Beachy](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20890457-gay-berlin)



Really engrossing history, sociology and culture study. Traces prominent figured like Magnus Hirschfeld, founder of the Scientific Humanitarian Committee. Traces the history of a diverse queer scene from the 1800's to 1933. Loved this book and recommend to people all the time!



[Our Young Man by Edmund White](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663628-our-young-man?from_search=true)

I got this as an Advanced Reading Copy. I've had Edmund White on my radar for a while and enjoyed this one too. The plot isn't super original but it has great character portrayals and reminded me a bit of Irvine Welsh, who I adore.



[Speak My Language by Torsten Højer](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27834064-speak-my-language-and-other-stories?ac=1&amp;from_search=true)



An anthology of gay fiction. Pretty straightforward premise that doesn't prepare you for the breadth of genres and themes explored within. There's a fantastic sci-fi love story, a fair share of seedy hookup stories and gay tragedy, Patrick White nailing a whole British family vibe, a story featuring a seraphim that made me weep at the end like a baby. It covers the globe from Russia to Australia, Britain to Sri Lanka. There were only one or two stories I didn't find fantastic.



I got to meet Patrick White in store and tell him how great his story Brown Manilla was (I hadn't finished it at that point, thank god he didn't ask me how I felt about it!)



[A Boy's Own Story by Edmund White](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1025100.A_Boy_s_Own_Story?ac=1&amp;from_search=true)



I'll fess up: I haven't finished this one. The writing is vivid and feels honest, but I didn't get into it as much as Our Own Boy. I hope to finish this one before the year is up, as I have a collection of works by him to read too.



[Champagne Supernovas by Maureen Callahan](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18144103-champagne-supernovas?ac=1&amp;from_search=true)



Terrible title, but a fairly good little fashion biography about Marc Jacobs, Alexander McQueen and Kate Moss. 2/3 ain't bad. I just finished it yesterday and while it didn't stand up to things like Gods and Kings by Thomas, it was a easy read to pass the time.

(Basically there are two version. One that makes people more attracted to women and one more attracted to men. In men one will make them have more children the other will make them gay)



Also, the UK has recently allowed the use of CRISPR to remove genetic related diseases. This will likely lead the way for more legal DNA editing in the future not only in the UK but in other countries.



Now here's the question. Would you remove or not remove the Lesbian/Gay genes? If so why? If not why?

So with some positive advice/feedback I want to know if its worth starting a youtube channel, now I know many people say unless you have something unique about you don't try. Now when it comes to the terms I'm considered a ""stud"" and from what I've see there's not more than 10 that are on youtube that is actually committed, now I said that to say I think that's something unique ya know because to be honest most of the lesbians on youtube are feminine(or a stem) all though that doesn't matter what so ever but for me to be a female that ""looks different"" that's sort of something that could make me different. I tried my hardest to say that all without it even being a bit rude or ignorant lol so sorry if something looks crazy or out of place, I've never really asked this before.(so sorry for all the freaking terms I know some people hate the labeling but it was just me trying to explain everything) So do you all think it would be a decent idea or am i out of my mind?

147,"Okay so I'm an 18 year old ftm that lives in the south. I grew up in a religious black household where my mom is extremely conservative and a baby boomer. She doesn't like anything related to LGBT or anti-Christian. 



Yesterday I told my mom it was hard to talk to her because she was so close minded. She was confused because when I was younger we were really close. I asked if she loved me. She said yes. I asked her if it was unconditional. She said of course because I'm her youngest child. I asked: hypothetically speaking, what if I was gay, would you still love me no matter what? She said are you gay? I said no, but what if I was, would you still love me the same. She said I'd pray for you. At this point I was frustrated because I wanted to know how she would honestly react if I told her I was trans, but she wouldn't answer the questions properly!



I told her: If anything that would make me even more suicidal.

She asked me if I was suicidal and I answered yes. She was really quiet and was thinking a lot. 



She asked if I was gay, I told her no. I told her ""It's hard talking to you because you are so close minded and insensitive to certain topics. I don't want to lose you because you are all I have and I don't want you to hate me. You always choose religion over me and I don't know if you would kick me out for being something you don't condone. I don't want to be alone, I want you to accept me. I can't stand to think that you would be disgusted at me and kick me out or whatever.""



She kept guessing ridiculous things for what I might be and she never guessed trans. She asked when did this start and I said 10 years old. That threw her off entirely. She said if she wanted me to visit a therapist so she could understand more of why I was so depressed. I refused to go to a Christian-based therapist and she said okay. 



She said she was going to book an appointment to one that wasn't religious as hell and I made sure the therapist was someone young and who would have a better understanding of what I'm going through. 



She's still guessing what I could possibly be, but I'm waiting until we go to the therapist so I can tell her from start to finish.



Can you guys reassure me that I am doing the right thing here? She really wants to understand how I'm feeling. She said she would never kick me out and she isn't violent whatsoever. But I keep thinking about telling her to cancel the appointment because I constantly think about the negatives and what could go wrong. I have no one to talk to about this except for you guys. Please help me.",1
174,"At work today we had a diversity inclusion type event where they ask a question and you go to the center of the room if it applies to you. This is meant to help people see that they have more in common with some people than they thought, and also that people they thought were just like them might have differences. Some of the questions were light hearted, like do you like to dance or do you have pets. But then they asked if anyone was LGBT and for reference this is in the Bible Belt at a company owned by publicly very conservative people. It's not a topic that comes up often and I'm afraid to be out at work. When they asked that no one else went up, and I was too afraid. It was like a blacked out for a second, my ears were ringing. I feel guilty for not representing my community and for allowing others here at work to continue thinking all employees here are straight and narrow. I wish I could be vocal and proud but I'm just afraid. I'm new in my career and who knows if I would be treated differently or held back for it.

Today my sis was laughing at the ""First black president"" Clinton joke, my dad said that was disgusting and nasty. And that Americans have their culture and black people have theirs(Africans to be specific). He also said that's how here in America they let two men sleep and in Europe they have gay male hotels or something like that. My sister was like ""Ew disgusting""! My father also said him and my mom did not know what homosexuality was until they came here and learned what it is, saying it with a very negative tone.



Now I've already said on my other posts I am a closet bisexual in a Christian household that is every traditional. I used to pray people see the light and support marriage equality and stop being ignorant and stop hating others the way they are. I couldn't give two shits anymore. I will let fools be fucking ignorant and try to dictate others life, and watch as the LGBT community get more rights and equal treatment, and these homophobic, biphobic, transphobic bastards will be left behind.



Frankly, I don't give a fuck about changing anybody's ignorant mind.

We go to a school that is in a rural area, and tend to get isolated with each other, unless we make an effort to get out of that group.

One of my roommates is gay, and he has openly come onto me, and my other two roommates have come onto me (especially during the winter when we were stuck together) and I started to for the first time consider romance with a man. I find my roommates unattractive, even repulsive because of their hygiene and personal confidence, but I too have had low self esteem because of the lack of romantic validation.

56,"The reason I ask is because I've had a serious drinking problem my whole adult life. 30 year old male now. I've been to counseling, I've been to AA, nothing helps and the more I try to quit the worse it gets.



Well around 2012 I had a bit of a revelation about myself, and that's that I don't really identify as male. I'm never truly happy unless I'm with a woman, but my behavior and mannerisms always come off as more feminine, which in turn scares straight girls away and leads me to take up alcoholism.



Anyways, once I had this revelation about myself was when my drinking really took a turn for the worst. That was when drinking on the weekends started turning into daily self medicating. I've tried talking to several people throughout the years, but I live in rural Ohio. The responses I get range from indifference to straight up anger. The topic of gender identity is a very, very touchy subject and most people around here flat out hate the existence of transgender people.



So yeah, that sucks. Lots of self medicating. I'm looking at AA meetings and see a LBGT one tonight, wondering if maybe that's the place for me? But then I'm wondering if I'm even part of that community, like are they gonna be like ""no you're too straight to be here""?

Me: 30, lesbian, married to a man. Wants out of marriage. Tried talking to husband about it, he's in serious denial. He goes from thinking it's funny to thinking it's an ""excuse"" to end the marriage (which I guess means it's not a good enough reason to him? Honestly I don't get it but whatever.). He says things like ""I don't care if you sleep with girls but no men!"" As if I'm asking him for an open marriage or something. He doesn't get it. My parents are homophobic and my dad is actually violently misogynistic so I can't talk to them.



(Trigger, sexual assault) I'm avoiding all intimate contact with my partner at the moment. Last night he woke up in the middle of the night and reached over me to open a window, and I screamed ""NO! PLEASE DONT!"" because I thought he was going to rape me. It was just an impulsive reaction, it's not something I fear in my daily life with him. I'm just really coming to a breaking point with this.



Does anyone have advice for getting my husband to accept this and explain it in a way that makes sense to him? 



Also, does anyone have advice about coming out ""later"" in life? I feel very alienated from mainstream LGBT+ culture because I wasn't out in adolescence. I feel very alone. 



I know I should probably just dump the guy straight up and then get therapy, but I really need help getting to a place mentally to do that. Any insight is really appreciated. I'm scared.

76,"Hi there,



I wanted to share this with you. Something I’m sure you all experienced at some point and also because I’m so disappointed with my coworkers now.



I was finishing lunch (I work in a restaurant) with a bunch of people from my work when I mentioned that today is my best friend’s birthday and that we would go to a Japanese restaurant - leaving on the side these comments. One of the woman from the kitchen said to me: ‘Enjoy the evening with your girlfriend’ and I answered to her: ‘Oh, it’s my best friend’s birthday I didn’t say girlfriend’. She insisted about the girlfriend so I came out. I must say she is like 45-50 and I believe she was the only one who didn’t know I was gay. Then everything was oddly stupid.



‘Have you ever tried a woman?’ I answered her gently I didn’t have to try anything I was born like this and women are not food for you to try and decide if you like them or not and I asked her: ‘how can you know you’re not into women either if you’ve never been with one?’ And she said: ‘I don’t need to try, I know I like men’ and I finished the conversation with: ‘Then it works the same with me’.



After that, I was very disappointed because no one who knew I was gay didn’t say a word to support me or defend me. They even found funny when I was asked if I had ever tried girls. 



When this woman from the kitchen left, two of my coworkers said to me that I should excuse her cause she is old and she has a very different culture from us. Funny thing when I’m from Spain - currently living in a London and they are from different countries as well. I said I was tired of excusing people by their age, we all grow up and learn to see the world differently. Our truth may be someone else’s lie. After that, one of my friend said that anyway no child should have two dads or two mums and in that moment I exploded. I answered that what she was saying was completely bullshit. A child shouldn’t learn about gender rules, fuck al that pink stuff for girls and boy don’t cry. Fuck all that toxic masculinity that we don’t need, it’s 2018. Boys and girls should be raised equally and received love and a good education, that’s it. That’s al they need to be good people.



I’m sorry I’m just disappointed and wanted to share my story. Sorry for all the say and answer. I truly need some more verbs. What do you do in these situations? Because after all that I tried with them I don’t think I could change their point of views in any way.
