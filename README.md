# Detecting Minority Stress
- LGBTQ+ individuals face minority stress due to stigma, prejudice, and discrimination.
- Social media, such as Reddit, is a valuable platform for detecting and classifying minority stress.
- This project explores machine learning models to detect minority stress in Reddit posts.

## Methodology
- Annotated dataset used for training machine learning models.
- Self-curated dataset labeled into two classes: stress or no stress.
- Performance evaluation of deep learning and ensemble models.
- Experiments conducted with unbalanced, oversampled, and undersampled datasets.
- Different vectorization techniques used (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, GloVe).

## Results
- Ensemble learner based on Max-Voting performed the best on an unbalanced dataset of 12,073 Reddit posts.
- TF-IDF vectorization yielded an accuracy of 85.2% and an AUC-ROC value of 0.991.

## Minority Stress in LGBTQ+ Community
- LGBTQ+ individuals face challenges in coming out and often encounter rejection.
- 40% of LGBT adults have experienced rejection from family or close friends.
- LGBTQ children often experience harassment and assault at school, affecting their mental health.

## Minority Stress Theory
- Stressors from a homophobic culture contribute to health disparities in sexual minorities.
- Lifetime harassment, mistreatment, discrimination, and victimization are common stressors.
